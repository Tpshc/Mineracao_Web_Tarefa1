Abstract—This paper considers an energy harvesting underlay
cognitive radio network operating in a slotted fashion. The secondary
transmitter scavenges energy from environmental sources in half
duplex fashion and stores it in finite capacity rechargeable battery.
It splits each slot into two phases: harvesting phase and transmission
phase. We model the energy availability at the secondary user
as first order stationary Markov process. We propose a robust
online transmission policy by jointly optimizing the time sharing
between the two phases and transmit power of secondary user, which
maximizes its average throughput by a given time deadline. We show
the comparison of our proposed policy with the offline and myopic
policies.
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, there have been many developments for im-
proving the bandwidth and energy efficiency of a wireless com-
munication network. Energy harvesting cognitive radio network
(EH-CRN) is one such solution which improves the bandwidth
efficiency of the network while ensuring perpetual operation of
the devices at the same time [1]–[3]. In a CRN, a set of unlicensed
users share the spectrum allocated to licensed users in a way
such that the licensed user can achieve an acceptable quality of
service (QoS). The unlicensed and licensed users are also known
as secondary user (SU) and primary user (PU) respectively.
Depending on the way of sharing, the CRN can be classified
into three categories: interweave, overlay and underlay.
In underlay EH-CRN, the SUs and PUs coexist in an in-
terference limited scenario and may harvest energy from the
environmental sources. The secondary transmitter (ST) transmits
its data using the spectrum allocated to PU while keeping
acceptable interference at the primary receiver (PR). EH-CRN
operating in underlay mode has been studied in [4]–[10]. We
briefly summarize the related literature and present our main
contribution.
In [4] and [5], authors considered an underlay EH-CRN with
multipacket reception model. The SU transmits not only when PU
is idle, it also transmits with a probability p when PU is occupying
the channel. Both works studied the stable throughput region
and obtained optimal transmission probability p maximizing the
SU’s throughput. However, [4] considers an EH-PU whereas, [5]
considers two different scenarios, EH-SU and, EH-PU and EH-
SU. In [6], authors considered an underlay EH-CRN with one PU
and multiple EH-SUs. The SUs harvest RF energy from primary’s
transmission and use multihop transmission along with TDMA
to transmit their own data. Authors jointly optimize the time and
power allocation maximizing the end-to-end throughput. In [7],
authors considered a scenario where multiple EH-SUs communi-
cate with an intended receiver using TDMA. The authors jointly
optimize the power and time allocation which maximizes the sum
rate of the SUs. In [8], a scenario is considered where a SU
communicates with the receiver via multiple energy harvesting
decode-and-forward relays while ensuring the outage probability
of PU is below an acceptable threshold. The authors obtained the
outage probability of the SU for Nakagami-m channel in closed
form. In [9], authors considered a single pair of PU and SU
operating in underlay mode. The EH-SU operates in half duplex
fashion and harvests energy from PU’s transmission for the first
fraction of the slot and then transmits its data in the remaining.
Authors aim to obtain a myopic policy which optimizes the time
sharing between the two phases and maximizes the sum rate of
SU under PU’s outage constraint. In [10], authors consider the
same system model as in [9] and maximize the sum throughput
of the SU by jointly optimizing the time sharing and power
allocation among the slots.
We consider an underlay EH-CRN where the PU has a reliable
energy source and SU is equipped with a rechargeable battery and
harvests energy from the environmental sources such as solar,
vibration, RF etc. Similar to the system model presented in [9]
and [10], in our model, the SU operate in slotted half-duplex
fashion, i.e., at any given time, SU can either harvest energy
from the environment or transmit its data. We consider both
the energy and channel uncertainties in our model which to the
best of our knowledge, has not been studied in the literature in
the context of EH-CRN. We model the uncertainty in energy
harvesting process as a first order stationary Markov process as
in [11] and the estimated channel gains are assumed to have
bounded uncertainty as in [12], [13]. The main contributions of
this paper are as follows:
• We propose a robust online time sharing policy taking
energy arrival and channel uncertainties into consideration.
We formulate the problem of maximizing secondary av-
erage sum throughput by a given time deadline (short-
term throughput) subject to energy harvesting constraint
of secondary transmitter (ST) and interference constraint
of primary receiver (PR) as a finite horizon discrete-time
Markov decision process (MDP) [14].
• We solve the optimization problem using finite horizon
stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) [14], [15] and com-
pared the performance of our proposed online policy with
the myopic [9] and offline policy [10].
• In addition, we also investigate the effects of various system
parameters such as different channel conditions, radius of
the uncertainty region, battery capacity and interference
threshold at PR on the proposed time sharing policy.
The organization of the paper is as follows. System model
is presented in section II which includes the energy arrival
model, battery dynamics and channel uncertainty model. Problem
formulation is presented in section III. We discuss the results in
section IV and finally, we conclude the paper in section V.

A. Underlay EH-CRN Operating in Slotted Mode
The underlay EH-CRN operating in slotted mode, is shown in
Fig. 1. In our model, the ST scavenges energy from the envi-
ronment1 and stores it in rechargeable battery of finite capacity.

corresponding to PT-PR, PT-SR, ST-PR and ST-SR link in the
ith slot respectively. Both PT and ST transmit simultaneously for
N slots, each of duration 1 second. In each slot, the PT uses
a constant power pp for transmission. However, the secondary
transmitter (ST) splits every ith slot into two phases: harvesting
phase and transmission phase of duration (1??i) and ?i second
respectively, where 0 ? ?i ? 1. In harvesting phase of ith
slot, ST harvests energy and stores it in the battery of maximum
capacity Bmax and then in the transmission phase, it transmits
its data to the secondary receiver (SR) with power pis Watt. The
ST chooses its transmission power such that it causes at max Pth
Watt of interference at the PR.

(AWGN) at SR.
B. Energy Uncertainty Model
This section presents our model of energy uncertainty. We first
present the energy harvesting process and then, we study the
battery dynamics governed by the harvesting process.
1) Energy Harvesting Process: In our model, the ST has
energy harvesting capability and harvests energy from the envi-
ronmental sources. We assume that the ST operate in half duplex
mode such that in the beginning of each slot, the SU first harvests
energy from the environment with a rate Eih J/s for some fraction
of time, and then transmits its data in the remaining duration of
the slot.
In energy harvesting, the energy arrival time and amount are
not known in advance and are random in nature. In order to
capture this randomness, we model the process of energy as a
first order stationary Markov process with Ms number of states
as in [11]. The state transition probabilities are assumed to be
known at the ST apriori. In practice, these transition probabilities
can be estimated by observing the energy arrival pattern. At
the beginning of ith slot, the ST harvests the energy from the
environment at a harvesting rate Eih which takes values from a
finite set E = {eh1 = 0, e
h
2 , · · · , e
h
Ms
}, where eh1 = 0 represents
that no energy is harvested. In this paper, we consider Ms = 2
without any loss of generality.

Fig. 2 shows a two state Markov process, where Pij , i, j ?
{1, 2} are transition probabilities defined as
Pij = P(e

We denote the state transition probability matrix by T such
that [T]ij = Pij , which is assumed to be known apriori. The

, i = 2, . . . , N + 1
2) Battery Dynamics: Since the energy harvesting process
follows first order Markov process, so do the battery dynamics.
The energy available in the battery at the beginning of each slot
depends upon the energy harvested and energy consumed in the
previous slot.
In the ith slot, the ST harvests energy for 1 ? ?i fraction of
slot with a rate Eih and then, transmits its data for ?i fraction
of the slot with power pis. If Bi is the state of the battery at the
beginning of ith slot, we have
0 ? ?ip
i
s ? Bi, ?i. (1)
If Bmax denotes the capacity of the battery, the energy
available in the battery at the beginning of (i + 1)th slot can
be expressed recursively as
Bi+1 = min
{
Bi + (1? ?i)E
i
h ? ?ip
i
s, Bmax
}
, ?i, (2)
where (1??i)E
i
h and ?ip
i
s represent the harvested and consumed
energies in the ith slot respectively. We assume B1 = 0 without
loss of generality.
Both the harvested energy and battery state jointly determine
the time sharing and transmit power in a slot. Therefore, we can
form a new first order Markov process whose states are defined
as the joint state of energy harvesting states and battery states.
The ith state of this new Markov process, Qi can be defined as
Qi ,
?
?
?
B1, for i = 1
(Ei?1h , Bi), for i = 2, . . . , N
BN+1, for i = N + 1
(3)
The state transition probability of this new Markov process is
given as
P (Qj | Q1, . . . , Qj?1) = P (Qj | Qj?1) , j = 2, . . . , N + 1
C. Channel Uncertainty Model
We assume the coherence time of the fading channel to be
equal to the slot length, i.e., the channel coefficients remain
constant for each time slot but may vary from one slot to other.
The ST can estimate the channel coefficients between itself to
PR using channel reciprocity [17]. However, due to practical
constraints such as feedback delay or estimation errors, the
estimated channel coefficients may be erroneous. Therefore we
assume the CSI of PT-SR and ST-PR links to be imperfect with
bounded uncertainty [12], [13].
Under bounded uncertainty, the actual channel coefficients of
PT-SR and ST-PR links can be written as
gps = g?ps +?gps
gsp = g?sp +?gsp
where g? and ?g are the estimated channel coefficient and the
estimation error respectively. Without assuming any statistical
knowledge about the error, we bound the estimation error as
|?g| ? ?, where ? ? 0 is the radius of the uncertainty region. We
assume the estimated channel coefficients g?ps and g?sp to be zero
mean complex Gaussian with variances ??2ps and ??
2
sp respectively.
III. PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. Online Policy
The transmit power of ST, pis is controlled by the state of the
new Markov process, Qi as well as the interference threshold
at the PR, Pth. Our aim is to obtain optimal ? and p?s which
maximizes the worst case short-term average throughput of the ST
considering the energy harvesting constraints of ST, interference
threshold at PR, and imperfect CSI. The optimization problem is
given as

that in any slot, we can use as much energy as we have

a stochastic optimization problem where conditional expectation

optimization problem can be rewritten aiming for robust online

the worst case instantaneous achievable throughput of ST in ith
slot.
The optimization problem (5a)-(5c) can not be solved for
each slot independently due to time coupled constraint (4b).
Therefore, we first rewrite the optimization problem in (4a)-(4e)
as a classical finite horizon MDP by reformulating the constraint
(4b) as (2) and combining the constraints (4c) and (4d). The
optimization problem can now be rewritten as

The resulting optimization problem (6a)-(6d) can now be
solved optimally using finite horizon SDP [14], [15]. The optimal
values of optimization variables p?s and ?? are obtained using
backward induction method [14] and are calculated in time
reversal order. The SDP algorithm is given in Algorithm 1.
Proposition. The optimal last state of the newly formed Markov
process is Q?N+1 = BN+1 = 0.
The proposition states that by the end of the transmission,
all the energy harvested would be consumed and in the end of
last time slot, energy causality constraint will be satisfied with
equality, i.e.,
N+1
?
j=1

It follows from the fact that it is always suboptimal to have
some energy left in the battery at the end of the transmission.

B. Myopic Policy
In the myopic policy, the SU aims to maximize its immediate
throughput in each slot and therefore, it consumes all the har-
vested energy for transmission in the same slot. In this case,
the throughput in each slot can be maximized by optimizing
the time sharing parameter ?? only. Under myopic policy, the
transmit power of SU in ith slot is given by pis =
(1??i)
?i
Eih.

which is a convex optimization problem and can be solved using
any standard convex optimization solver such as CVX [18].
C. Offline Policy
In the offline policy, all the channel coefficients and energy
arrivals are assumed to be known apriori. The offline policy
outperforms the myopic and online policies in terms of sum
throughput and acts as a benchmark for these policies. The
optimization problem for robust offline policy is given as [10]:

which is a convex optimization problem and can be solved using
any standard convex optimization solver such as CVX [18].
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
For simulation, it is assumed that the PT uses a constant power
of pp = 2 Watt in all the slots for transmission, and ?
2
n = 0.1. The
number of states of the energy harvesting process is assumed to
be Ms = 2, such that Eh takes values from the discrete set S =
{eh1 = 0, e

Since we are considering discrete time SDP, the optimization
variables, ?i and p
i
s are considered to be discrete with step size
of 0.2.
A. Effect of uncertainty region radius ? on secondary throughput
Fig. 3 shows ST’s average sum throughput (Ravgsum) averaged
over different channel realizations for different values of un-
certainty region radius ? under the optimal online time sharing
policy. The variances of all the channel links are assumed to be
unity, i.e., ?2pp = ?
2
ps = ?
2
sp = ?
2
ss = 1, interference threshold
Pth = 1 Watt, and Bmax = 1 Joule. The effect of radius of
uncertainty region on the worst case average throughput is clearly
visible from the figure. As ? increases, the average throughput
decreases due to two reasons. First, increasing ? reduces the
instantaneous throughput and second, from the constraint (5c),
increasing ? puts more stringent constraint on the transmit power
p?s which in turn, reduces the average throughput.
B. Effect of different channel conditions on throughput
Fig. 4 shows ST’s average sum throughput for various channel
conditions under optimal online time sharing policy. For simu-
lations, we assume that the weak and strong channel links have
variance 0.1 and 1 respectively, e.g., in case of weak PT-SR link,
we assume ?2ps = 0.1 and ?
2
pp = ?
2
sp = ?
2
ss = 1, Pth = 1 Watt
and ? = 0.05. In case of all channel links to be equally strong,
we assume ?2pp = ?
2
ps = ?
2
sp = ?
2
ss = 1. From the figure, it is
noticed that the secondary throughput increases as the link ST-PR
becomes weak. This results in low interference constraint at PR
allowing the ST to transfer information with high power which in
turn, results in higher throughput. The weak PT-SR link causes
low interference at SR, therefore the throughput increases. The
weak ST-SR link degrades the secondary performance because
of poor channel gains. When all links are equally strong, the

performance lies in between that of the weak ST-PR link and
weak ST-SR link. This is because when weak ST-PR link allows
ST to transmit with higher power, weak ST-SR negates this gain
from weak primary interference resulting in no throughput gain.
C. Effect of interference threshold Pth on average harvest-
ing/transmission time
Fig. 5 shows the variations of average harvesting/transmission
time with the change in interference threshold at the SR, Pth.
The plot is obtained for fixed number of secondary slots N = 8,
radius of uncertainty region ? = 0.05, and variances of channel
coefficients are assumed to be same as in section IV-A. As the
value of Pth increases, SU can transmit with more power, which
can be obtained by consuming more energy in less amount of
time as P is = E
i
s/?i, where E
i
s is the energy consumed by ST in
ith slot. Therefore, the harvesting time increases and transmission
time decreases so that the ST can accumulate more energy and
can transmit with higher power.

Fig. 6. Average sum throughput of ST (Ravgsum) versus number of slots (N) for
different values of battery capacity Bmax
Fig 6 shows the effect of battery capacity on the average
achievable throughput of ST. The radius of uncertainty region
is assumed to be ? = 0.05 and all other parameters are same as
in section IV-A. As we decrease the battery capacity, secondary
throughput reduces. This effect of the battery capacity can be
observed from constraint (6b). When battery capacity is reduced,
Bmax dominates in constraint (6b) and the next state in the
battery is limited by Bmax, i.e., this constraint does not allow the
ST to harvest the energy it needs, which reduces the throughput.
As battery capacity is increased, the ST can accommodate more
energy and therefore can transmit with higher power whenever
channel conditions allow. Fig. 6 shows that after a limit, further
increment in battery capacity has no impact on the throughput as
in this case, first term in constraint (6b) becomes dominant and
Bmax has no effect on the next state of the battery.

Fig. 7. Energy versus number of slots (N = 7) under optimal online policy
Fig. 7 shows the nature of harvested and consumed energy with
number of secondary slots N . All the simulation parameters are
kept same as in section IV-A and ? = 0.05. From the figure, it
is clear that in order to satisfy the energy causality constraint
in (4b), consumed energy always remains less than or equal
to harvested energy and, the remaining energy is less than the
maximum storage capacity Bmax = 1 Joule. Since it is a joint
optimization of time and energy and it will not harvest energy
which it can’t use. Therefore at the end of the transmission, all
the harvested energy is consumed under the optimal online policy.
F. Performance comparison between the optimal online, offline
and myopic time sharing policies
Fig. 8 shows the comparison of online, offline and myopic
policies in terms of average sum throughput of ST. All simulation
parameters are same as in section IV-A. The offline and myopic
policies considered for comparison are adopted from [9] and [10],
and modified slightly in accordance with our system model. The

Fig. 8. Average sum throughput of ST (Ravgsum) versus number of slots (N) for
optimal online and offline policies
figure shows that the average sum throughput of ST for online
policy lies in between the offline and myopic policies. Since in
the offline policy, all the channel gains are assumed to be known
apriori, the ST obtains the optimal policy before the transmission
starts and therefore, achieves much higher throughput. Therefore,
it acts as a benchmark for the online transmission policy. On
the other hand, the myopic policy tries to maximize immediate
throughput and consumes all the harvested energy in the same
slot and therefore performs worse than the online policy.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We proposed a robust online time sharing policy that max-
imizes the throughput of SU under energy arrival and channel
uncertainties. The proposed policy jointly optimizes the time
sharing between the harvesting phase and transmission phase,
and the transmit power of ST. The results show that our proposed
policy outperforms the myopic policy and unlike offline policy,
it does not require any prior information of energy arrivals and
channel gains. However, the computational complexity of our
policy is more than that of the myopic and offline policies as
the SDP suffers from curse of dimensionality.
