Abstract—Doubly-near-far problem in RF-powered networks
can be mitigated by choosing appropriate device-to-device (D2D)
communication mode and implementing energy-efficient infor-
mation transfer (IT). In this work, we present a novel RF energy
harvesting architecture where each transmitting-receiving user
pair is allocated a disjoint channel for its communication which
is fully powered by downlink energy transfer (ET) from hybrid
access point (HAP). Considering that each user pair can select
either D2D or cellular mode of communication, we propose
an optimized transmission protocol controlled by the HAP that
involves harvested energy-aware jointly optimal mode selection
(MS) and time allocation (TA) for ET and IT to maximize the
sum-throughput. Jointly global optimal solutions are derived
by efficiently resolving the combinatorial issue with the help
of optimal MS strategy for a given TA for ET. Closed-form
expressions for the optimal TA in D2D and cellular modes are
also derived to gain further analytical insights. Numerical results
show that the joint optimal MS and TA, which significantly
outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of achievable RF-
powered sum-throughput, is closely followed by the optimal TA
scheme for D2D users. In fact, about 2/3 fraction of the total user
pairs prefer to follow the D2D mode for efficient RF-powered IT.
I. INTRODUCTION
With the advent of 5G radio access technologies [1], the
ubiquitous deployment of low power wireless devices has led
to the emergence of device-to-device (D2D) communications
as a promising technology for performance enhancement by
exploiting the proximity gains. Despite these merits, the un-
derlying challenge is to provide sustainable network operation
by overcoming the finite battery life bottleneck of these
devices. Recently, the efficacy of energy harvesting (EH)
from dedicated radio frequency (RF) energy transfer (ET) has
been investigated to enable controlled energy replenishment
of battery-constrained wireless devices [2]. However, due to
fundamental bottlenecks [2], such as low energy reception
sensitivity and poor end-to-end ET efficiency, there is a need
for novel RF-EH based D2D communication protocols.
In the pioneering work on wireless powered communica-
tion network (WPCN) [3], the optimal time allocation (TA)
for downlink ET and uplink information transfer (IT) from
multiple EH users was investigated to maximize the system
throughput. It was shown that WPCN suffers from the doubly-
near-far-problem which limits its practical deployment. Al-
though optimal cooperative resource allocation strategies [2],
[4] have been proposed, in this work we focus on the efficacy
of D2D communications in resolving this issue by exploiting

proximity. Despite the pioneering research on WPCN [3]–[5],
the investigation on EH-assisted D2D communications, where
both the information source and the destination are energy
constrained, is still in its infancy [6]–[9]. In [6], performance
of the D2D transmission powered solely by ambient inter-
ference in cellular networks was investigated using stochastic
geometry. The joint resource block and power allocation for
maximizing the sum-rate of D2D links in EH-assisted D2D
communication underlying downlink cellular networks was
studied in [7]. Recently, D2D communication powered by am-
bient interference in cellular networks for relaying machine-
type communication traffic was investigated in [8]. An inte-
grated information relaying and energy supply assisted RF-
EH communication model was presented in [9] to maximize
the RF-powered throughput between two energy constrained
devices. However none of the above mentioned works [6]–
[9] investigated the fundamental problem of mode selection
(MS) and resource sharing between cellular and D2D users, as
done in conventional D2D communications [10]. In the recent
work [11], without considering EH, joint optimization of MS,
uplink/downlink TA, and power allocation was performed
to minimize the energy consumption in meeting the traffic
demands of a D2D communication network. To the best of our
knowledge, the harvested energy-aware joint MS and TA has
not been investigated for RF-powered D2D communications.
Here, different from conventional D2D systems [10], [11], the
optimal decision-making is strongly influenced by the TA for
EH during downlink ET from the hybrid access point (HAP).
In comparison to RF-powered cellular networks, RF-EH as-
sisted D2D communication also provides pairing gain, where,
as shown in Fig. 1, each user pair can select either D2D or
cellular mode of communication based on the harvested energy
and radio propagation environment. D2D mode enables short-
range and low-power links saving the power consumption at
the transmitter, and thus assisting in overcoming the doubly-
near-far problem [3]. On the other hand, communicating via
an energy-rich HAP in cellular mode can help in increasing
the end-to-end IT range. Apart from MS, the total transmission
time needs to be allocated optimally for IT and ET in D2D
and cellular modes to maximize RF-powered throughput. So,
we need to tackle two trade-offs: (i) choosing between D2D
and cellular mode; and (ii) time sharing between ET and IT.
The key contributions of this work are four fold. (1) Novel
RF-EH communication model and transmission protocol are
presented to enable efficient sustainable D2D communications.
(2) A joint optimization framework is proposed to maximize
sum-throughput of the system by optimally selecting the
transmission mode (D2D or cellular) along with TA for ET
and IT. Although this is a combinatorial problem which is NP-
hard in general [11], we demonstrate that it can be effectively
decoupled into equivalent convex problems to obtain both
individual and joint global optimal MS and TA solutions. (3)
Closed-form expressions are derived for: (i) optimal TA for
D2D and cellular modes of communication between a single
EH pair; and (ii) tight approximation for optimal TA with fixed
D2D mode for all nodes. We also provide analytical insights on
the harvested energy-aware optimal MS strategy for a given TA
for ET. (4) Throughput gains achieved with help of proposed
optimization framework over the benchmark schemes involv-
ing fixed TA and MS are quantified by numerical simulations.
These results incorporating the impact of practical RF-EH
system constraints also validate the accuracy of the analysis
and provide useful insights on the jointly optimal solutions.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a heterogeneous small cell orthogonal fre-
quency division multiple access (OFDMA) network with a
single HAP and multiple RF-EH users that are fully-powered
by dedicated RF energy broadcast from the HAP. Without loss
of generality, we focus on the RF-powered IT among N RF-
EH users, denoted by {U1,U2, . . . ,UN}, that are interested
in communicating within this small cell. We assume that N2
non-overlapping frequency channels are available to enable
simultaneous communication between these possible N2 user
pairs. The transmitter and receiver in each user pair are pre-
decided and allocated a disjoint frequency channel [10], [11].
Each RF-EH user is composed of a single omnidirectional
antenna. To enable simultaneous reception and transmission of
information at different frequencies in the uplink and down-
link, the HAP is equipped with two omnidirectional antennas,
one being dedicated for information reception and the other
antenna is dedicated for energy or information transmission.
Each N2 user pair chooses either (i) D2D mode where
nodes directly communicate with each other, or (ii) cellular
mode where they communicate via HAP in a two-hop decode-
and-forward (DF) fashion. Both D2D and cellular modes of
communication are solely powered by RF-ET from the HAP.
As the cell size is very small due to low RF-ET range of
the HAP [2], we have not considered the reuse mode [10]
to avoid strong co-channel interference. All the links are

assumed to follow independent quasi-static block fading; for
simplicity, we consider this block duration as T = 1 sec.
The instantaneous channel gains between the HAP and user
Ui for downlink ET and uplink IT are denoted by HUi and
?
Ui
HUi , respectively, where ?Ui is a positive scalar with
?
Ui
= 1 representing the channel reciprocity case. Similarly,
the channel gain between Uj and Uk is denoted by GUj ,Uk .
These channel gains {HUi , GUj ,Uk} can be defined as

where p is path-loss coefficient; h

and g

respectively
denote the channel fading components for HAP-to-Ui and Uj-
to-Uk links; n is path-loss exponent; d0,Ui and dUj ,Uk respec-
tively denote HAP-to-Ui and Uj-to-Uk euclidean distances.
We assume that the HAP has the full acquisition of instan-
taneous channel state information (CSI) of links to all users,
including the CSI between all possible
N(N?1)
2 user pairs. This
CSI is estimated by the respective receivers and then fed back
to the HAP via the control channel [10], [11]. Although the
proposed HAP-controlled optimization algorithm is based on
instantaneous CSI which incurs a lot of signalling overhead,
it can serve as a benchmark for distributed algorithms [11].
As the desired frequency characteristics for efficient ET and
IT are different [2] and the maximum end-to-end ET efficiency
is achieved over narrow-band transmission [5], we consider a
pessimistic scenario by ignoring EH during downlink IT from
the HAP. Also, since the received uplink signal strength from
energy constrained users is relatively very weak in comparison
to the transmit signal strength in the downlink IT from the
energy-rich HAP, we do not consider full-duplex operation
at the HAP. Instead, we propose an enhanced half-duplex
information relaying where orthogonal frequencies can be
received and transmitted simultaneously using two antennas.
III. PROPOSED TRANSMISSION PROTOCOL
As shown in Fig. 2, the proposed transmission protocols for
both cellular and D2D modes of communication are divided
into RF-ET of duration te sec and IT phase of duration 1? te
sec. This downlink RF-ET based IT forms a WPCN [3]. Next,
we discuss the sub-operations in these two phases in detail.
Phase 1): RF-ET from the HAP to all the EH users: During
RF-ET phase, HAP broadcasts a single-tone RF energy signal
xe [5], having zero mean and variance P0, to all EH users.
The energy signal ye,Ui thus received at user Ui is given by
ye,Ui =
?
HUixe + zUi , ?i ? {1, 2, . . . , N} , (2)
where z
Ui
is the received Additive White Gaussian Noise
(AWGN) at Ui. Ignoring EH from noise signal zUi due to
very low energy reception sensitivity [2], the energy E
H,Ui
harvested at Ui over the RF-ET duration of te sec is given by
E
H,Ui
= ?
Ui
P0HUite, ?i ? {1, 2, . . . , N} , (3)
where ?
Ui
is RF-to-DC rectification efficiency of RF-EH unit
at Ui which is in general a nonlinear function of the received
RF power [12]. If Ui is a receiver, then harvested energy EH,Ui
is stored for carrying out internal node operations. Otherwise,
E
H,Ui
is solely used for carrying out IT from Ui to HAP, if it
follows cellular mode, or to its receiving partner in D2D mode.
Phase (2): RF-Powered IT: The operations in this phase
depend on the transmission mode, i.e., cellular or D2D.
a) Cellular Mode: The IT phase is divided into uplink
and downlink subphases. By exploiting the availability of
disjoint channels and two antennas at the HAP, we consider
different uplink and downlink IT times, as denoted by 1 ?
te? td,Ti and td,Ti , for efficient cellular mode communication
between transmitter Ti and receiver Ri of ith user pair with
Ti, Ri ? {U1, . . . ,UN} and 1 ? i ? N/2. The transmit power
PCTi of Ti for IT to HAP using its harvested energy EH,Ti is
PCTi =
?E

=
??
Ti
P0HTi te
1?te?td,Ti
, (4)
where ? is the fraction of E
H,Ti
available for IT after excluding
the internal energy losses. Although we only consider the en-
ergy harvested during the current block for carrying out IT, the
proposed optimization can be easily extended to the scenario
where transmit power is given as PCTi =
?
(
E
S,Ti
+E
H,Ti
)
1?te?td,Ti
with
ES,Ti denoting the stored energy available at Ti for IT at the
beginning of the current block. The information signal received
at the HAP due to this uplink IT from Ti is given by
yu,Ti =
?
PCTi?TiHTixu,Ti + z0, (5)
where xu,Ti is the normalized zero mean information symbol
transmitted by Ti having unit variance and z0 is the received
AWGN at the HAP having zero mean and variance ?2. After
decoding the message signal from yu,Ti , the HAP forwards
the decoded message signal x?u,Ti to the receiving cell user
Ri in the second subphase of phase 2. Cellular communication
between Ti and Ri completes upon downlink IT from the HAP
to Ri. The information signal yd,Ri as received at Ri is
yd,Ri =
?
?
Ri
HRiP0x?u,Ti + zRi , (6)
where P0 is transmit power of HAP and zRi denotes zero mean
AWGN having variance ?2. ?
Ri
incorporates the difference in
HAP-to-Ri channel characteristics for downlink ET and IT [5].
Since the HAP acts like a DF relay [10] with 1? te? td,Ti
and td,Ti being time allocations for uplink and downlink IT,
the RF-powered throughput for cellular mode communication
between Ti and Ri, as obtained using (5) and (6), is given by
?CTi,Ri = min

(1? te ? td,Ti) log2

With ?ULTi,Ri = (1? te ? td,Ti) log2
(

and ?DLTi,Ri = td,Ti log2

respectively
representing uplink and downlink rates, throughput ?CTi,Ri de-
fined in (7) can be rewritten as: ?CTi,Ri = min
{
?ULTi,Ri , ?
DL

}
.
b) D2D Mode: Under this mode, Ti directly communi-
cates with Ri by forming a D2D link. With IT phase of 1? te
duration, the transmit power PDTi of D2D transmitter Ti is
PDTi =
?E
H,Ti
1?te

Ti

. (8)
The corresponding information signal yd2,Ri received at Ri is
yd2,Ri =
?
PDTiGTi,Rixd2,Ti + zRi , (9)
where xd2,Ti is the zero mean and unit variance information
symbol transmitted by Ti of ith user pair choosing D2D mode.
So using (8) and (9), the RF-powered throughput for the
D2D mode communication between ith user pair is given by
?DTi,Ri = (1? te) log2
(
1 +

Ti
P0HTiGTi,Ri te

. (10)
With the above two throughput definitions, we investigate the
joint optimal MS (between D2D and cellular) and TA (for dif-
ferent phases) policy for the sum-throughput ?S maximization.
IV. OPTIMAL TIME ALLOCATION
In this section we first investigate the concavity of the RF-
powered throughput in TA for both cellular and D2D modes.
Then, we derive the expressions for globally optimal TA.
A. Concavity of Throughput in TA
We first show that the throughput ?CTi,Ri in cellular mode
communication between users Ti and Ri is jointly concave
in TAs te and td,Ti by proving the concavity of ?
UL
Ti,Ri
and
?DLTi,Ri . The Hessian matrix of ?

is given by H

Zi, te, and td,Ti are positive with te + td,Ti < 1, we notice
that
?2?ULTi,Ri
?t2e
,
?2?ULTi,Ri
?t2d,Ti
< 0, and the determinant of H
(
?ULTi,Ri
)
is zero. This proves that H
(
?ULTi,Ri
)
is negative semi-definite;
hence, ?ULTi,Ri is concave in te and td,Ti . Also, the downlink rate
?DLTi,Ri is linear in td,Ti and independent of te. Finally, with
the minimum of two concave functions being concave [13],
the joint concavity of ?CTi,Ri in te and td,Ti is proved.
The strict-concavity of throughput for D2D mode in te is
shown by

B. Global Optimal TA Solution
Using (7), the throughput maximization problem for cellular
mode communication between Ti and Ri can be defined as
(OP) : maximize

?CTi,Ri = xi, subject to :
(C1) : xi ? ?
UL
Ti,Ri , (C2) : xi ? ?
DL
Ti,Ri ,
(C3) : te + td,Ti ? 1, (C4) : te, td,Ti ? 0.
Keeping the positivity constraint (C4) implicit and associating
Lagrange multipliers ?1, ?2, ?3 with remaining constraints,
the Lagrangian function for OP is given by L , xi ?
?1 [t+ td,Ti ? 1] ? ?2
[
xi ? ?

? ?3
[

. The
corresponding optimality (KKT) conditions [13] are given by
constraints (C1)–(C4), dual feasibility conditions ?1, ?2, ?3 ?
0, subgradient conditions ?L?xi ,
?L
?te
, ?L?td,Ti

[

DL

= 0. To allocate
non-zero time for uplink IT, te + td,Ti < 1, which results
in ??1 = 0. Using this in
?L
?xi
, ?L?te ,
?L
?td,Ti
= 0, implies that
for ?CTi,Ri > 0, ?
?
1 = 0, ?
?
2 > 0, and ?
?
3 > 0. Using ?
?
2 > 0
and ??3 > 0 in CSC deduces to xi = ?
UL
Ti,Ri
= ?DLTi,Ri . This
implies that the optimal TA td,Ti for downlink IT from the
HAP to receiver Ri is such that the uplink and downlink rates
become equal, i.e., ?CTi,Ri = ?
UL
Ti,Ri
= ?DLTi,Ri . On solving this,
the global optimal TA t?d,Ti for downlink IT is given by

(i.e., D2D mode).
(13)
In general JP is a combinatorial problem as it involves binary
variable {mi}. However, we next present a novel harvested
energy-aware optimal MS strategy that resolves this issue and
helps in obtaining the jointly global optimal solution of JP .
A. Optimal Mode Selection Strategy
For a given TA te, the analytical condition for throughput
of RF-powered communication between Ti and Ri of ith user
pair in D2D mode to be higher than that in cellular mode is:
?DTi,Ri > ?

Now if GTi,Ri ? ?TiHTi , implying that direct link quality
is better than the uplink quality, then from (14) we note that
?DTi,Ri ? ?
C?

or mi = 1 for any feasible te because D2D
mode is more energy-efficient and provides higher throughput
for the same amount of harvested energy. Whereas if GTi,Ri <

{

}
, then it can be
shown that for te > t
th
e,i, D2D mode is preferred by the ith user
pair over the cellular mode, and vice-versa. This holds because
if ? tthe,i ? (0, 1), then ?te ?
(
tthe,i, 1
)
, ?DTi,Ri > ?
C?
Ti,Ri
due to
strictly decreasing nature of ?C
?
Ti,Ri
in Fi, the rate of increase of
?C

is lower than that of ?DTi,Ri , ?te > t
th
e,i. The value of this
threshold tthe,i implies that even when uplink quality is better
than direct link between Ti and Ri, D2D is better mode than
cellular for te > t
th
e,i because the resulting harvested energy
makes it more spectrally-efficient as compared to the cellular
mode involving redundant transmission during downlink IT.
B. Jointly Global Optimization Algorithm
Using thresholds {tthe,i}
N/2
i=1
, the optimal MS for each EH
user pair can be decided based on TA te for ET. So, we divide
the feasible range for te into
N
2 + 1 subranges based on
N
2
thresholds {tthe,i}. For each of these subranges, the optimal MS
policy {m?i }
N/2
i=1
can be obtained using the discussion given in
Section V-A. Further, using the concavity of {?DTi,Ri}
N/2
i=1
and
{?C
?
Ti,Ri
}
N/2
i=1
in TA, as proved in Section IV-A, we note that
the sum-throughput ?S for optimal MS {m
?
i } is concave in TA
te because it is a sum of
N
2 concave functions comprising of
either {?DTi,Ri} or {?
C?
Ti,Ri
}. Hence, the global optimal MS and
TA can be obtained by selecting the subrange that gives the
maximum sum throughput. We have summarized these steps of
the proposed joint global optimization strategy in Algorithm 1.
In Algorithm 1 after dividing the feasible te range, optimal
TA t?e for each of the possible
N
2 + 1 MS scenarios is
obtained using the Golden Section (GS) based one dimensional
(1D) search with acceptable tolerance ? ? 1 (implemented
in steps 26 to 33). The upper and lower bounds for each
search are either based on the thresholds {tthe,i} or on {t
D?
e,i },
as defined in (12) for pair i having worst and best average
link qualities, respectively. So, we conclude that Algorithm 1

VI. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
For generating numerical results we consider that N nodes
are deployed randomly following Poisson Point Process (PPP)
over a square field of area L×L m2 with the HAP positioned at
the center. This field size L ensures that the average received
power for a given path-loss exponent n and average fading
parameter HTi is higher than the minimum received power
sensitivity of ?20 dBm for practical RF-EH circuits [9]. So,
as n is varied from 2 to 5, maximum field size L decreases
from 23.4 m to 4.4 m. For user pairing we have considered
that node i pairs with node N ? i+ 1, ?i = {1, 2, . . . , N/2}.
The graphs in this section are obtained by plotting the average
results for multiple random channel realizations and multiple
random node deployments with unit average channel fading
components {HTi , HRi , GTi,Ri} and path-loss coefficient p.

Firstly, we investigate the throughput gain achieved with
the help of proposed joint MS and TA optimization over the
benchmark schemes that include fixed communication mode
(all nodes are either in cellular or D2D mode) and uniform TA
for each phase where te = td,Ti =

2 for D2D mode. Results in Fig. 3 show that the joint
optimization scheme provides significant gains over the fixed
TA and MS schemes. These gains which scale with increased
system size N , get enhanced with diminishing field size L
due to increased path-loss exponent n for both 20 and 40 user
systems. Furthermore, the throughput performance of D2D
mode for both optimal TA and fixed TA is much better than
that for the corresponding cellular mode communication. In
fact, the performance of optimal TA with all nodes selecting
D2D mode is very close to that of joint optimal strategy. The
reason for this can be observed from the results plotted in
Figs. 4 and 5. From Fig. 4 we observe that irrespective of field
size L, about 2/3 fraction of the total users prefer D2D mode.
As the D2D mode involves direct IT, it is more spectrally-
efficient and can allocate higher t?e for ET as shown in Fig. 5.
Since joint MS and TA involves both D2D and cellular modes,
its t?e lies between that of all-D2D and all-cellular scenarios.
We numerically quantify the average optimal uplink and
downlink IT times in cellular mode. Fig. 6(a) shows that
optimal uplink IT time is much higher than optimal downlink
IT time due to significantly low link quality for uplink IT from
energy constrained users. On the contrary, downlink involves
IT from energy-rich HAP. Further, the IT times (of both uplink
and downlink) for joint MS and TA are relatively lower than
that for scenario where all nodes follow cellular mode because
the former selects only the pairs that have better uplink and
downlink qualities for cellular mode communication.
From Figs. 3 and 4, it was noted that optimal TA with all
nodes selecting D2D performs very close to jointly optimal
MS and TA. So, in Fig. 6(b) we have compared the variation
of ?S achieved by optimal TA scheme with fixed D2D mode for
all nodes against that achieved by considering tight analytical
approximation t?D?e for t
?
e as obtained by substituting the
average channel gain for the RF-powered D2D IT link in (12).

Fig. 6(b) shows that although the quality of approximation gets
degraded with increasing N , it is still very much acceptable
as the average percentage error is always less than 1.5%.
Next we present graphical insights on optimal MS. In Fig. 7
we have plotted two N = 10 user deployments with L = 1
unit and shown optimal MS in each case. User pairing is same
as discussed before, i.e., user 1 transmits to 10, 4 transmits to
7, and so on. We note that when transmitter (Tx) and receiver

(Rx) are placed almost opposite to each other with the HAP
being in the center and far from the Tx, then cellular mode is
preferred. Otherwise, mostly (? 66% times) D2D is preferred.
Finally via Fig. 8, we show that the joint optimization
scheme taking advantage of proximity can achieve spectral
efficiency gains by optimal MS and can effectively solve the
tradeoff between efficient ET and IT by optimal TA. As a result
it provides significant gain in terms of ?S over that achieved
by benchmark scheme having uniform TA for all three phases
(ET, uplink and downlink IT) with all nodes selecting cellular
mode. Fig. 8 also shows that higher gains are achieved when
the average link qualities become poorer due to increased n.
VII. CONCLUSION
We have presented a novel system architecture and transmis-
sion protocol for efficient the RF-powered D2D communica-
tions. To maximize the sum-throughput of RF-EH small cell
OFDMA network, we have derived the joint global optimal
MS and TA by resolving the underlying combinatorial issue.
Analytical insights on the impact of harvested energy on
the optimal decision-making have been provided. We have
observed that the jointly optimal MS and TA can provide about
45% enhancement in achievable sum-throughput. Lastly, we
have showed that with our proposed joint MS and TA about
66% nodes follow D2D mode, and the optimal TA scheme
with fixed D2D mode for all nodes very closely follows the
sum-throughput performance of the jointly optimal scheme.
