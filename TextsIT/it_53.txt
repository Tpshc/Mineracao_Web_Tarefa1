(Dated: September 5, 2017)
Double slit interference experiment is at the heart of quantum mechanics by clearly presenting
quantum nature of particles such as electrons, photons, neutrons and molecules as emphasized by
Richard Feynman. In this article, Feynman path integral formalism and quantum superposition
of propagating particles are combined in a multi-plane and multi-slit based interference set-up
to present a novel quantum computing (QC) architecture denoted by quantum path computing
(QPC) without utilizing qubits and gate operations but exploiting superposition interference on
the intensity distribution on the sensor planes. Hidden subgroup problem (HSP) is solved with a
period finding solution in complete analogy with the existing period finding algorithms utilizing
qubits and quantum gate structures. The system is used as a promising step for the solution of
NP-hard simultaneous Diophantine approximation problem in algebraic number theory and non-
uniform reciprocal integer lattices. Simulation results taking into account effects of exotic and
non-classical paths show feasibility of QPC for providing quantum computational speed-up. QPC
is an alternative architecture to existing QC methods having the challenges of noise, decoherence,
high complexity of hardware and low number of qubits. It provides a low complexity design, low
cost and room temperature operation as a promising step to realize polynomial solutions to some
sets of computational problems requiring exponentially complex resources of time and memory.
Keywords: Quantum computing, Feynman path integrals, interference, NP-hard, simultaneous Diophantine
approximation, non-uniform integer lattice, polynomial complexity.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Young’s double slit experiment is one of the funda-
mental experiments where the foundational laws and the
essence of quantum mechanics are contained as empha-
sized by Richard Feynman with detailed models for the
electron based system set-up [1]. The importance given
to the experiment by Feynman motivates to create a sim-
ple system design exploiting fundamental laws of quan-
tum mechanics such as quantum superposition and Born
rule to realize low complexity quantum computing (QC)
architectures. QC architectures are recently promising
quantum supremacy by utilizing qubits based on a rich
set of materials including superconducting structures,
quantum dots or trapped ions [2], annealing based adia-
batic architectures [3] and topological quantum comput-
ing intrinsically error-protected by utilizing non-Abelian
anyons [4]. The most fundamental problems in tradi-
tional systems are the noise with imperfections in quan-
tum operations and the decoherence due to entanglement
of qubits with the outside environments [5]. Furthermore,
operation temperature, complexity of the hardware and
small number of qubit realizations are other fundamental
challenges in existing systems. Exploiting quantum su-
perposition without utilizing qubit operations and gates
achieves better protection from the noise and decoher-
ence. The proposed solution denoted by quantum path
computing (QPC) is an alternative QC architecture to
existing academical and commercial prototypes. QPC
? burhan.gulbahar@ozyegin.edu.tr
satisfies fundamental features of naturally inspired archi-
tectures combining simplicity, adaptability to different
interference environments of particles including photons,
low complexity and low cost architecture of the device
operating at room temperature [6]. It exploits the super-
position of significantly large number of operations with
a simple design instead of complicated set-ups to realize
high number of qubits and reliable quantum circuit gates.
The double slit experiments are recently getting more
attention to analyze exotic paths of particles, Gouy phase
effect in measurement of the Sorkin parameter and the
fundamentals of Born rule [7–10]. The simplicity of slit
based interference experiments and their experimental
verification in recent studies further support experimen-
tal feasibility of QPC design.
Besides that, there are studies utilizing interference for
factoring problems. Implementation of Gauss sum with
optical interferences and Talbot effect produced by laser
pulses are discussed in [11]. N -slit classical interferome-
ter by using monochromatic light interference on a sin-
gle plane and the similar design with Mach-Zehnder in-
terferometer are presented in [12] and [13], respectively.
Multi-path interference patterns with Michelson interfer-
ometers, generalized truncated Fourier sums with Mach-
Zehnder interferometers and similar set-ups are shown in
[14, 15]. However, these systems do not include multiple
planes to form exponentially increasing number of paths
while requiring exponentially large resources. They are
not modeling the accurate interference patterns by using
Feynman’s path integrals and exotic paths, not target-
ing the simultaneous Diophantine approximation (SDA)
problems and not providing a direct one-to-one analogy
with the period finding traditional QC algorithms.

FIG. 1. (a) Quantum superposition interference and quantum path computing (QPC) architecture with multiple, consecutive
and parallel planes of slits, (b) ith and jth paths interfering on the detector array, and (c) exotic path among the slits with
indices a, b, c and d, and (d) reflecting paths between the consecutive planes of the slits.
In this article, a simple set-up based on quantum su-
perposition interference of fundamental particles due to
multiple planes with multiple slits is utilized to create a
QC solution of the period finding type for hidden sub-
group problems (HSPs). The analogy with traditional
period finding quantum algorithms utilizing qubits and
quantum gates is explicitly provided promising QPC as
a fundamental tool to be utilized in future computing
architectures. QPC provides a theoretical model for ac-
curate solutions of SDA problems with scalable count of
real numbers as NP-hard problems in algebraic number
theory with many applications in computer science, op-
timization theory and communications technologies. It
is a low complexity, simple, low cost and room tempera-
ture QC architecture utilizing quantum superposition of
exponentially increasing number of paths with respect to
the number of planes and slits. Numerical simulations
are performed by also accurately considering the effects
of exotic paths discussed in [7–10]. QPC promises poly-
nomial time solutions for some SDA problems with large
number of inputs while determining the class of prob-
lems which can be efficiently solved is an open future
issue. The open issues to be solved for realizing QPC
prototype as an alternative QC system are discussed in
Section VIII. QPC method promises further studies for
experimental verification and mathematical modeling of
the set of problems that can be solved, i.e., determin-
ing the computational complexity class of problems solv-
able in polynomial time such as a group of NP-hard SDA
problems or improving NP-intermediate (NPI) problems
solvable with traditional QC algorithms [16].
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Sections II and III, the physical set-up and the model of
QPC are presented based on Feynman path integral for-
malism. Then, in Section IV, fundamental formulation
of the computational power is modeled while in Section
V, solutions for HSPs and SDA problems are presented.
In Section VI, effects of exotic paths are modeled while
in Section VII, numerical simulations are performed. Fi-
nally, in Sections VIII and IX, the open issues and con-
clusions are presented, respectively.
II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
Assume that there are N ? 1 planes of slits in front of
a particle source such as electrons or neutrons, and the
interference pattern behind the last plane, i.e., plane with
the index N?1, is observed by a detector array or screen
denoted by the plane index N as shown in Fig. 1(a). The
particles are assumed to perform free space propagation.
The jth plane has Sj,T ? 2Sj + 1 number of slits where
the central positions and the widths of the slits are given
by Xj,i and Dj,i, respectively, where j ? [1, N ? 1] and
i ? [?Sj , Sj ], and the set of ordered slit positions on
jth plane is denoted by the column vector ~Xj. The row
vectors are represented with the transpose operation, i.e.,
(.)T . In the following sections, the widths of the slits are
chosen uniformly along each plane but differently among
the planes. The whole set of the slit positions on N ?
1 parallel planes are denoted by XN?1. The distance
between ith and jth planes is given by Li,j where the
3
distance from the particle emission source to the first
plane and from (N ? 1)th plane to the detection plane
are given by L0,1 and LN?1,N , respectively. The behavior
of the particle is assumed to be classical in z-axis with
the velocity given by vz while the quantum superposition
interference is assumed to be observed in x-axis as a one
dimensional model. The model can be easily extended to
the two dimensional (2D) systems. The distance between
the planes is assumed to be much larger compared with
the slit widths and the slit positions in x-axis.
The time duration for the particle to travel between
(j ? 1)th and jth planes is assumed to be tj?1,j =
vz /Lj?1,j for j ? [1, N ] where tN?1,N denotes the ob-
servation time after the particle passes through (N?1)th
plane. The position in x-axis on jth plane is denoted by
xj while the wave functions of a specific nth path and su-
perposition of all the previous paths on jth plane are de-
noted by ?n,j(xj) and ?j(xj), respectively. Inter-plane
distance and inter-plane duration vectors are represented
by ~L = [L0,1 . . . LN?1,N ] and ~t = [t0,1 . . . tN?1,N ],
respectively. The paths of the particle are assumed
to be indexed by n for n ? [0, Np ? 1] as shown
in Fig. 1(b) where Np =
?N?1
j=1 Sj,T and Pathn ?
{sn,1, sn,2, . . . sn,N?1; sn,j ? [?Sj , Sj ]}. Therefore, the
slit position for nth path on jth plane is given by Xn,sn,j .
The number of paths given by Np can be significantly
large for even a small number of planes and slits, e.g.,
reaching > 1012 distinct paths interfering on the detec-
tor plane for N?1 = 12 and Sj = 5 for j ? [1, 12]. There
are some assumptions making the model more clarified:
• The plane material is assumed to be absorbing
without particle reflection between the slits mak-
ing calculation much more complicated as shown in
Fig. 1(d) while exotic paths are taken into account
as shown in Fig. 1(c). The particle interfering on
the detector plane is the one passing freely through
the slits with free space propagation.
• Calculation of the inter-plane durations by tj?1,j =
vz /Lj?1,j is highly accurate due to Lj?1,j ?
Dj?1,i, Xj?1,i for j ? [2, N ? 1] and i ? [?Sj, Sj ],
and setting L01, LN?1,N ? Lj?1,j in simulation
studies (verified by simulation studies for the ef-
fect on the detector plane intensity) such that the
quantum effects are emphasized in x-axis.
• Non-relativistic modeling of the particle behavior
is assumed since the gravitational effects are ne-
glected in the proposed dimensions.
• As a proof of concept, the source is a single Gaus-
sian wave function while the slits are modeled as
having Gaussian widths with Feynman path inte-
gral approach [1].
Next, Feynman path integral formalism is utilized to
model the interference on the detector screen.
III. MULTI-PLANE AND MULTI-SLIT
INTERFERENCE MODELING
The wave function on the detector plane for a spe-
cific path index n denoted by ?n,N (x) is calculated
by using Feynman path integrals by using the free
particle kernels [1]. Assume that K(x1, t1;x0, t0) =?
m/ (2 ? ? ~?t)exp(?m?x2 / (2 ~?t)) denotes the free
particle kernel for the paths between the time-position
values (t0, x0) and (t1, x1) where ?t = t1 ? t0 and
?x = x1 ? x0, m is the free particle mass and ~ is the
Planck’s constant. Assuming that xj for j ? [1, N ? 1]
denotes the integration variable for the slit with the in-
dex sn,j and position Xj,sn,j in nth path and
?
~x d~x de-
notes the integration with respect to the variables xj
for j ? [0, N ? 1] between the limits ?? and ?, then
?n,N(x) is given by the following:

where tj = t0 +

notes the effective function of the slit with the index sn,j
on jth plane for nth path, e.g., rectangular or Gaussian
slits as described in [1], and ?0(x0) is the source wave
function. The resulting integration is described in terms
of linear canonical transforms (LCTs) providing a more
intuitive description of the effects of interference on the
final wave function for each path. LCT of a function f(x)
is defined as follows [17]:
LCTa,b,c,d{f(x)} ? e??

and a d ? b c = 1 for a given set of parameters (?, ?, ?).
Then, it is easily shown that the evolution of ?0(x0) in
nth path is represented by the block diagram as shown
in Fig. 2 where LCTn,j{.} denotes the LCT with the
following transformation matrix:

path index n due to the classical approximation in z-
axis. It is also called as chirp or Fresnel transform in

optical signaling literature [17]. The wave function on
the boundary of each plane is denoted by ?n,j(x) for
j ? [1, N ? 1] while ?n,N(x) denotes the final wave func-
tion on the detector plane. Next, QPC method is pre-
sented where superposition interference is uniquely ex-
ploited for QC.
IV. QUANTUM PATH COMPUTING
The interfering wave function on the image plane is
calculated based on Feynman path integrals and the re-
sult is transformed into a form to exploit quantum su-
perposition for performing quantum computing tasks.
Quantum wave pattern on screen is calculated by using
Gaussian beams and slits with the forms of Gn,j(x) =
exp(? x2 / (2 ?2j )) with identical slits over each plane but
with different effective slit widths Dj,i ? 2 ?j among
the planes, and ?0(x) = exp

[1, 7]. These assumptions can be replaced with different
slit models without modification in the main idea of QPC
but resulting into different functional forms of the path
integrals. After integrating in (1) with Gaussian slits
and Gaussian beam sources, the following wave function
is obtained on jth plane:

where j ? [1, N ], x corresponds to the position in x-axis
on jth plane and the iterative variables ?n,j , Aj , Bj , Cn,j
and Dn,j are defined in Appendix A. Then, the resulting
wave function ?n,N(x) is given by the following with the
proof given in Appendix A:

where H = HR + ?HI is composed of correlated real
HR and imaginary parts HI extracted from (9). This is
the main equation where the computational power of the
QPC resides. The combined design of ~xn, H, ~c, ~d and
AN?1 by choosing specific set of x-axis samples promises
a solution to a significant number of optimization prob-
lems including huge memory and time complexities with
significantly large Np. The quantum superposition in
the measurement provides information about the collec-
tive behavior of H, ~c and ~d for exponentially large num-
ber of sample vectors ~xn with a summation over them.
Assuming that Np = (2S0 + 1)
N?1 where Sj = S0 for
j ? [1, N ? 1], then a single measurement at the sample
position x provides the information about the collective
result of (2S0 + 1)
N?1 × (N ? 1) multiplications per-
forming ~dT ~xn for n ? [0, Np ? 1]. Similar to the tradi-
tional quantum algorithms exploiting superposition, e.g.,
period finding, Grover search or factoring or more gen-
erally denoted as hidden subgroup problem (HSP) [16], a
clever way is necessary to best utilize the QPC power of
(10) as provided in the next section.
The number of degrees of freedom to tailor the matrices
for a general QPC set-up is
?N?1
j=1 Sj,T + N + (N?1) +
1 =
?N?1
j=1 Sj,T + 2N where the first summation term is
due to distinct positions of slits in each plane, the term N
due to the number of inter-plane distances, the termN?1
due to different slit widths ?j for j ? [1, N ? 1] and the
last term due to ?0. In the following sections, a specific
QPC set-up refers to the tuned parameters of ~?, ~L, ?0
and Ts for the specific grid XN?1 forming the vectors ~xn
for n ? [0, Np ? 1] and the vector ~d defining the number
theoretic problem where Ts refers to the sampling period
on the detector plane. Next, QPC framework is utilized
to solve HSP for periodicity of e? 2 ?
~dT ~x with respect to
~x or SDA problem for the set of real numbers which are
(2 ?)?1 Ts scaled versions of ~dT ~xn for n ? [0, Np ? 1].
V. HIDDEN SUBGROUPS FOR NON-UNIFORM
RECIPROCAL INTEGER LATTICES
Traditional QC algorithms exploit the superposition
qubit state generated with quantum Hadamard trans-
forms applied on two registers initially at |0? |0? and func-
tional evolution with controlled unitary transforms U in
black boxes for a given periodic function f(x) = f(x + r)
[16]. The QPC equation in (10) allows to find the peri-
odicities in e? 2 ?
~dT ~x as a complex problem for arbitrary
sets of XN?1 and ~d as defined in the following problem
definitions and Table I. The continuous intensity is renor-
malized and sampled to extract periodicities by defining

where the measurement location x is represented in terms
of the samples k Ts for integer indices k ? [??,?] and
the sampling period Ts, and ?[n, k] is as follows:
?[n, k] = ~xTn HI ~xn +
~dT ~xn k Ts (12)
The analogy between the traditional QC period finding
(the algorithm in Section 5.4.1 in [16]) and QPC period
finding is shown in Table I which is explained in detail
after defining the following computational problems:
Problem 1 Periodicity Detection and Reciprocal
Non-uniform Lattice: Find the minimum integer
k? ? Z+ scaling a given N ? 1 dimensional real vector
~d for a given non-uniform lattice denoted by XsN?1
(scaled with respect to XN?1) resulting in a reciprocal
integer lattice denoted by ? by minimizing the error
term ?n for n ? [0, Np ? 1] in a defined average sense
such that ? ? {k? ~dT ~xsn + ?n ? Z; ? ~xsn, n ? [0, Np?1]}
where the non-uniform lattice XsN?1 formed of a set of
real vectors ~xsn is defined as follows:
~xsn = (2 ?)
?1 Ts [~xn(1) . . . ~xn(N ? 1) ]
with ~xn(j) ? {Xj,?Sj , . . . , Xj,Sj}
s.t. Xj,i ?Xj,i+1 > 2??j ; N ? 2; ? ? 1
where n ? [0, Np ? 1]; j ? [1, N ? 1]; i ? [?Sj , Sj ? 1]
Sj , N ? Z+; ?j , Ts, ? ? R+; Xj,i ? R
(13)
where Np ?
?N?1
j=1 (2Sj + 1), and Z, Z
+, R and R+
denote the sets of integers, positive integers, real values
and the positive real values, respectively.
The optimization problem defined in Problem 1 re-
quests defining a set of integers scaling either ~d or XsN?1
such that inner product of ~d with all vectors in XsN?1 re-
sults in values very close to integers with errors given by
?n. The condition Xj,i?Xj,i+1 > 2??j satisfies that the
central positions of two slits are separated by the distance
at least as much as the summation of their half widths
where increasing ? results in better physical design to
satisfy Gaussian slit properties. The other conditions are
definitions of parameters of the physical set-up described
in Sections III and IV. Similarly, a parallel problem, i.e.,
SDA problem with NP-hard complexity modeled in [18],
is defined as follows:
Problem 2 Simultaneous Diophantine Approxi-
mation: Decide the existence and find the min-
imum integer k? ? Z+ where k? ? Kpre for some prede-
fined Kpre ? Z+ such that it is the SDA solution for the
set of real numbers in the set Sb = {b0, b1, . . . , bNp?1}
satisfying the relation |k? b[n]? kn| < ? for n ? [0, Np ? 1]
and for some kn ? Z specific to each n with the common
denominator k? where b[n] ? ~dT ~xsn and ? is the bound.
The first problem has an exponential complexity with
respect to N , i.e., requiring the inner product multipli-
cations for

lattices are well defined for Bravais lattices where the
crystal structure is defined by a transformation vector.
On the other hand, quasicrystals or crystals with non-
uniform set of grid points are more difficult to analyze
due to the lack of the strict order but rather repeating
patterns [19]. In the current case, the lattice XsN?1 has
not any assumption except that it is the intersection of
N ? 1 different sets of (N ? 2) dimensional planes where
the number of planes in each set j ? [1, N ? 1] is equal
to Sj,T and the planes are separated in a single dimen-
sion denoted with the position xj without any defined
periodicity or pattern.
The equivalent second problem is NP-hard as discussed
in [18] and it is assumed that the inner product set of
~dT ~xsn for n ? [0, Np ? 1] achieves the desired set of real
numbers b[n] by tuning the physical system set-up pa-
rameters in the QPC solution. The transformation map-
ping an arbitrary SDA problem to the physical set-up
parameters is left as a future work to be achieved based
on the fundamental model in this article.
Problems 1 and 2 are solved with a polynomial com-
plexity solution by utilizing (10-12) in combination with
a set of measurements on at x = k Ts as shown in the next
sections. The steps of the proposed QPC algorithm are
described as follows while the analogy with traditional
QC period finding is shown in Table I:
0. Real vector ~d and real grid XN?1 with elements
~xn for n ? [0, Np ? 1] are given where ~xn ?[
X1,sn,1 X2,sn,2 . . . Xk,sn,N?1
]T
and XN?1 is com-
posed of the positions Xj,i for j ? [1, N ? 1] and
i ? [?Sj, Sj ]. The function f(~x) = e? 2 ? ~d
T ~x has
periodicity with respect to ~x with the unknown
period k? and the given basis sets Sa : {~ra =?Np?1

odicity vector is given by k?

an ? Z and n ? [0, Np ? 1], and the target is to
find k? where ~xsn ? (2 ?)?1 Ts ~xn. The black box is
formed of QPC set-up with the ability to measure
superposition intensity.
1. Initial state is set up by designing the wave function
of the particle source.
2. The superposition is due to QPC set-up combining
Np different paths on the screen.
3. Black box is the QPC set-up with specially de-
signed parameters providing ~xn in the grid XN?1
and the vector ~d while related parameters ~c, H,
and the set-up parameters ~?, ~L, ?0 and Ts to be
optimally designed for the best estimation of k?.
4. A set of M ? k? samples are taken on the detector
plane and IFFT operation with the output time
index p results in information about p / k? and h / k?
for h ? [0, k? ? 1] where ?M [ pM , hk? ] is in (18).
5. The number of samples at varying p values is in-
creased until k? for a converging and unbiased esti-
mation of k?.

6. The estimation problem can be set as a parameter
estimation problem for the set of damped sinusoids
with diverging coefficients or the estimation can be
made easier if the set-up satisfies some special prop-
erties as described in the following sections. Tra-
ditional period finding algorithms with polynomial
time solutions are utilized to best estimate k?, i.e.,
O(M logM) complexity for FFT based solutions in
frequency estimation of damped sinusoids [20].
IFFT operation with the number of samples M de-
scribed in Step-4 is given as follows by using (11). Define
the following discrete functions of n as g1[n] ? ~cT ~xn Ts,
g2[n] ? ~dT ~xn Ts and g3[n] ? e~x
T
n H ~xn . Since ~d and
(2 ?)?1 Ts ~xn form an integer lattice for n ? [0, Np ? 1]
with the integer period k?, the expression e? g2[n] k is sim-
plified by e? G?2[n] 2 ? k / k? due to periodicity with k? where
G?2[n] is a function mapping the interval [0, Np ? 1] into
an integer between [0, k? ? 1] depending on relation be-
tween ~d and XsN?1. Then, if IFFT {Y }[p] denotes IFFT
of some discrete function Y [k] at the time index p, IFFT
with the size M by utilizing k ? [0,M ? 1] results in the
following:

plying coefficients of ?0 ? 2 ? / k? is ?G2[n, l] = G?2[l] ?
G?2[n] ? [?k? + 1, 2 k? ? 2]. Dividing the set of [n, l] pairs
in [0, Np ? 1]× [0, Np ? 1] into k? regions with the index
h ? [0, k?? 1] and denoted by Rh results in the following:

Then, if novel mathematical tools are designed utiliz-
ing g3[n] and g1[n] for computationally efficient estima-
tion of k?, each sample point on the detector plane in-
creases the estimation accuracy. Similar to the Bertocco
algorithm for the single sinusoid case [20], it is observed
that the exponentially increasing term in the numerator,
i.e., 1?e?[n,l]Me?? 2? h Mk? , results in fast phase oscillations
for each h ? [0, k? ? 1] if M < k?. Various performance
metrics are capable of detecting the high fluctuations,
e.g., the following metric denoted by R[M ] is expected
to be maximized around M ? k? as a polynomial com-
plexity solution:
R[M ] =
??IFFTM{I?}[0]
??
1
M?1
?M
k=1
??IFFTM{I?}[k]
?? (20)
where the high frequency components are averaged and
their mean is compared with the zero frequency compo-
nent. Then, by checking the points of R[M ] with respect
to M , i.e., minimizing the high frequency components,
allows roughly determining k?. On the other hand, the
same periodicity is expected in R[M ] since at multiples
of k? the fluctuations are decreased. Next, the solution of
the SDA problem with the QPC algorithm is proposed.
A. QPC Solution of the SDA Problem
The existence of k? ? Kpre ? M is checked by the ex-
istence of high fluctuation points in solution of the SDA
problem defined in Problem 2. If there is no fluctuation,
it is an indication of the absence of the bounded error ?
such that the solution of the SDA problem does not exist
for k ? M . On the other hand, if there is a fluctuation,
the set of fluctuating points are the best candidates for
the SDA solution periods and it is necessary to test them
and chose the best result. Moreover, the classical period
finding algorithms with polynomial computational com-
plexity are promising to find the periodicity if it exists
[20]. However, formal mathematical proof for the deci-
sion of the SDA solution existence depending on more
detailed models of ~d and XN?1 combined with H and
~c in (10) is left as a future work providing the metric
for the fluctuation compared with the other values in the
interval 1 ? k ? M to decide in favor of the existence
of SDA solution. Furthermore, the set of SDA problems
whose solutions are achieved by a specific QPC set-up
should be mathematically modeled. In this article, ex-
ample problems are simulated to show the simple and
low complexity solution achieved by QPC as a proof of
concept promising future system designs providing sim-
ple QPC solutions to specific sets of SDA problems.
Besides that, the polynomial solutions in SDA problem
and the performance of the well defined Lenstra, Lenstra
Jr., and Lovasz (LLL) algorithm for large number of in-
puts become highly prohibitive for Np ? 1 [18]. As-
sume that ||x|| denotes the distance of the real number
8
x to the closest integer, the maximum of ||k? b[n]|| for
n ? [0, Np ? 1] is smaller than some pre-defined ?p and
there is some pre-defined bound M with M > k?. Then,
the LLL algorithm provides the estimation of k? denoted
by k? satisfying 1 < k? < 2Np / 2 M and the maximum
of the ||k? b[n]|| being smaller than
?
5Np 2
(Np?1) / 2 ?p
with the number of operations depending on the input
size [18]. Therefore, QPC algorithm not only promises a
powerful approach as a candidate to solve the NP-hard
problem for the decision of SDA solution existence and to
find it but also improves the existing polynomial solution
approaches requiring significant time steps and memory
with a limited accuracy.
The error term for the SDA problem is defined
as ?[n,M ] ? min{||M b[n]||} for n ? [0, Np ? 1].
Then, ?[M ] ? (1 /Np)
?Np?1
n=0 ?[n,M ], ?max[M ] ?
max
n
{?[n,M ]} and ?min[M ] ? min
n
{?[n,M ]} are good in-
dicators for observing how M is close to the solution of
the SDA problem, i.e., k?. If, in future studies based on
the proposed model in this article, it becomes possible to
provide a set-up for a special number theoretical problem
by transforming it into a specific instance of approximat-
ing the solution of a SDA problem, then QPC system per-
forms as a potential solver in polynomial time. However,
the formal mathematical proof of modeling the family
of the problems requires more analysis as a future work.
On the other hand, although the accuracy of the digits
of the SDA solution can be increased, there is potentially
a limit to the accuracy due to combined effects of phys-
ical parameters including ~, ?, and the inaccuracies in
the coordinates of the physical locations, the distances of
the planes, the widths of the slits and the plane thick-
nesses requiring further work on the highest accuracy of
solving a specific SDA problem. Therefore, number the-
oretic problems should be converted to a model where
minimizing ?[M ] should give an acceptable solution.
In the following chapters, in addition to IFFT based
fundamental technique, two different approaches are in-
troduced which may become more effective, i.e., utilizing
special property of g3[n] and g1[n] resulting in period-
icity in the local maximum of I?[k] and considering the
problem as fundamental frequency estimation for a sum
of sinusoids. Estimation under heavy noise on the screen
requires more advanced methods to extract periodicity.
However, accuracy of IFFT method can be increased by
diversity combining methods, e.g., increasing signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) in each sample point and realizing mul-
tiple experiments consecutively or in parallel.
B. Periodicity Detection in the Intensity Local
Maximum
Assume that non-uniform lattice XsN?1 and vector
~d
are in a specific family providing the conditions defined
in Theorem 1 as follows:
Theorem 1 Assume that N?1 dimensional real vectors
~c and ~d, and a non-uniform grid XN?1 satisfy the fol-
lowing while constructing intensity I?[k] defined in (11):
1. ~d and Xs
N?1 form an integer lattice with the in-
teger period k? and the sampling interval Ts allow-
ing the simplification of the expression e? g2[n] k =
e?
~dT ~xnTs k by e? G?2[n] 2 ? k / k?.
2. |H [k, G?2]| < |H [k, 0]| and |H [k1, 0]| > |H [k2, 0]|
where 0 ? k ? k?, k2 < k1 ? k?, and k, k1, k2 ? Z,
and H [k, o] is defined as follows:
H [k, o] ?
Np?1?
n=0
g3[n]e
g1[n] (k??k)e?
? 2 ? o[n]k
k? (21)
where o[n] ? [0, k? ? 1] refers to a specific mapping of
n ? [0, Np ? 1] with a discrete function o(.) while H [k, 0]
refers to the case where o(n) = 0. Then, periodicity k? is
found by checking local maximums in intensity such that
the following is satisfied for k ? [0, k? ? 1]:
I?[k?] > I?[k] (22)
The proof is provided in Appendix C.
Then, checking local maximum points k? with random
samples of ~dT ~xn k? Ts / (2 ?) to verify for integer values
determines the periodicity k?. However, performance can
be increased by using various methods for frequency es-
timation of damped sinusoids as described in [20] such as
FFT based methods as shown in the next section.
C. Periodicity Estimation for Diverging Sinusoids
with Fundamental Frequency
The problem is considered as finding the fundamental
frequency ?0 = 2 ? / k? for the summation of complex
sinusoidal signals if (11) is transformed into the following:
I?[k] =
Np?1?
n=0
Np?1?
l=0
A[n, l]e?[n,l]k e???G2[n,l]?0 k (23)
The received intensity in noisy receiver case denoted by
Inorm,n[k] is modeled as follows:
Inorm,n[k] = Inorm[k] + n[k] (24)
where n[k] is the receiver noise modeled as Gaussian
random process with independent samples and with the
variance ?2k which becomes proportional to Inorm[k] if
Poisson distribution is assumed for photonic applications.
However, in simulation studies, various levels of SNR are
simulated. Then, normalized intensity is found as follows
where noise is amplified in normalization operation:
I?n[k] = I?[k] + n?[k] (25)

On the other hand, Cramer-Rao lower bound for the
variance of the best estimate of k? in noisy receiver case is
provided in the following theorem which is useful to find
performance of the best estimator:

mation of the periodicity in non-uniform integer lattice of
the QPC set-up by using a set of intensity measurements

where b(k?) ? E{k?} ? k? is the bias while the noise is
assumed to have zero mean.
The proof is provided in Appendix D. Next, the effects
of the exotic paths discussed in [7–10] are analyzed by
extending previous formulations to include the effects of
all possible exotic paths on the detector plane.
VI. EFFECTS OF EXOTIC PATHS
The evolved wave function is calculated by summing
contributions from both classical and exotic paths by pro-
viding a complete formulation of the QPC set-up. A sam-
ple exotic path is shown in Fig. 1(c). Assume that the
particle of nth path on jth plane makes k consecutive
visits to slits in addition to the first slit or the entrance
slit with the index sn,j and the position Xj,sn,j while
the case with k = 0 corresponds to the classical path
as shown in Fig. 3. Block diagram of evolution of the
wave function in nth path is shown where the path is ei-
ther a classical or an exotic path denoted with the same
notations of ?n,j(x) and ?n,j+1(x) on jth and j + 1th
planes, respectively. The wave function in the exotic path
after kth slit denoted by ?En,j,k(x) is explicitly provided
in Appendix E for k bounded by some predetermined
maximum number NE . The parameters of LCT
E
n,j,k{.}
depend on the distance between the slits on jth plane de-
fined as ?Ex (j, k) ? |Xj,sn,j,k ?Xj,sn,j,k?1 | where Xj,sn,j,k
denotes the central position of kth visited slit and k = 0
case corresponds to the position of the first slit on jth
plane, i.e., Xj,sn,j,0 ? Xj,sn,j . Then, setting a maximum
for NE and finding all paths for k ? [0, NE] give an accu-
rate result considering effects of all possible exotic paths.
The operator formalism for calculating Gouy phase in
[7] is utilized to calculate time durations for the path
distance ?Ex (j, k) with t

where ?j(x) is the total wave function on jth plane as a
superposition of all previous paths. The total number of
different paths between jth and (j+1)th planes including
exotic movements is denoted by Ne,j which is calculated
by the following formulation:
Ne,j = Sj,T

(Sj,T ? 1)k (28)
while the total number of all paths on ith plane for
i ? [1, N ] is given byNEp,i ?

of paths on the image plane is denoted by NEp,N which
is much larger compared with the case including only
classical paths, i.e., Np, and the total number of con-
tributions and effects of the exotic paths are simulated
in Section VII for the proposed sample problems. The
first term Sj,T shows different selections of the entrance
slit while the remaining k different slit visitings occur in
(Sj,T ? 1)k permutations. Finally, summing the contri-
butions for different k values until NE results in (28). In
the next section, numerical simulations are performed for
two different SDA problems as a proof of concept.

VII. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS
The proof of concept QPC set-up is formed with clas-
sically tractable number of planes and with simplicity to
verify the main features of the system design. Two dif-
ferent simulation experiments are achieved denoted by
Sim1 and Sim2, respectively. In Sim1, the real numbers
b[n] for n ? [0, Np ? 1] are chosen in a specific pattern
to allow for highly accurate solution to the SDA prob-
lem with significantly small error term. On the other
hand, in Sim2, SDA problem is defined for less accu-
rate solution with an optimization approach finding the
term minimizing the error in a large interval. The main
system properties are shown in Table III where the fun-
damental physical parameters are chosen based on the
electron beam based set-up verified for Gouy phase cal-
culations in [7]. Two different QPC problems solved with
the system set-up are shown in Table II. The presented
numbers are the rounded versions while the digits of pre-
cision are improved in MATLAB used for the simulations
by utilizing variable precision arithmetic (vpa) to allow
the contribution of path wave functions with significantly
small amplitudes compared with the other paths.
A. Simulation-1: Accurate SDA Solution and
Effects of the Exotic Paths
The number of slit planes is set to two with N = 3
and Si = 2 for i ? [1, 2] to observe the main mechanism
of QPC by explicitly analyzing wave functions on each
plane and clearly observing the effects of exotic paths.
The total number of classical paths on the image plane
is Np = 25 while the number of all paths including ex-
otic ones, i.e., NEp,N , for varying NE is shown in Table IV
for both Sim1 and Sim2. It is observed that as NE in-
creases, the number of exotic paths becomes significantly
large making it computationally complex to find the fi-
nal contribution on the image plane. It is observed that
intensity converges as NE increases and NE is chosen
as three and two for Sim1 and Sim2, respectively, with
reduced computational problems.
The fractional numbers forming the SDA problem are
shown in Fig. 4(a). They are chosen with a special pat-
tern to satisfy an accurate SDA solution at k? = 173. The
set-up parametersXsN?1,
~d, ~?, ~L, ?0 and Ts are designed
to provide the desired set of real numbers. In Fig. 4(b),
the error terms ?[M ], ?max[M ] and ?min[M ] are shown
for Sim1. The mean error term is smaller than 10
?8 for
M = k? = 173, which is assumed to be the SDA solution
for the current problem with the accuracy of eight digits.
In Fig. 4(c), the normalized intensity Inorm[k] is shown
while I?[k] and |H [k, 0]|2 are shown in Fig. 4(d) satisfying
both the conditions in Theorem 1 such that I?[k] > I?[0]
and I?[k] < |H [k, 0]|2 for k ? k?. Therefore, the value of
k? is easily extracted by checking either the periodicity or

the local maximum points of I?[k]. Besides that, IFFT
based method provides an accurate estimation of k? as
shown in Fig. 4(e). Fluctuations are more visible as M
increases at multiples of 173 while the maximum points
of R[M ] show periodicity of 173. On the other hand,
CRB is shown for varying SNR in Fig. 4(f) with a low
bound for the number of samples larger than a few tens.
Therefore, periodicity estimation methods for damped
sinusoids can be applied successfully such as [20].
The effects of exotic paths are simulated in Figs. 5 and
6. In Fig. 6, the intensity distribution on the planes of
slits and the image plane are shown. Five different peaks
are clearly observed on the second plane while interfer-
ing pattern is shown in the sensor plane and input wave
function due to freely propagating Gaussian beam of elec-
trons is shown on the first plane. The total normalized
intensity distribution including the exotic paths for vary-
ing NE is shown in Fig. 5(a). The main structure of the
distribution is preserved while the effects for increasing
NE are attenuated as shown in Fig. 5(b) for the case of
NE = 3 where periodicity and value of k? are still reliably
extracted. The same observation is preserved in R[M ]
for varying M in Fig. 5(c). The periodicity extraction
by utilizing smaller number of samples results in small
errors in the estimation of k? while a converging estima-
tion is observed for the specific problem in Sim1 as the
number of samples is increased. However, utilizing values
of I?[k] for large k requires higher precision measurement
instruments due to the significant attenuation at distant
sample locations and potentially longer time to collect
particles. Special tuning and design of QPC set-up can
solve most of the problems in future architectures based
on the fundamental idea of the QPC. Next, a more com-
plicated SDA problem is solved by finding the optimum
solution in a given interval minimizing error terms.
B. Simulation-2: SDA Problem for Larger Inputs
The number of slit planes is increased to N ? 1 = 4
and Si = 1 for i ? [1, 4] to realize a QPC solution for
a more complicated problem by approximating the SDA
solution of 81 real numbers. The effect of exotic paths on
the image plane is calculated for NE = 2 since the effects
of the exotic paths gradually decrease and it is enough to
calculate for NE = 1 and NE = 2 to observe the change
in received intensity waveform.
The set of fractional real numbers is shown in Fig. 7(a)
while the error terms of the SDA problem are shown in

and with less accurate solutions at multiples of k? min-
imizing the error terms. QPC algorithm is utilized to
find these optimum points by also including the effects
of the exotic paths. The normalized intensity and I?[k]
are shown in Figs. 7(c) and (d), respectively. The effects
of exotic paths are more powerful at central part of the
sensor plane while still keeping the envelope with period-
icity ? k?. Exotic path effects are smaller at non-central
part of the sensor plane similar to the results of Sim1.
IFFT based method reliably finds multiples of k? = 111
by utilizing samples in interval [0, 500] as shown in Fig.
7(e) with small errors around k?.
The model of the exact error in target periodicity is left
as a future work. The significant result is that the compu-
tational power of QPC finds existence of periodicity and
locates its position with a high accuracy in polynomial
resource complexity. Similarly, normalized intensity at-
tenuates very fast requiring higher precision sampling or
diversity combining methods to improve SNR at distant
sampling locations. There is a trade-off between accu-
racy of periodicity extraction by utilizing distant sample
locations and SNR of the particles.
VIII. DISCUSSION AND OPEN ISSUES
The QPC system design requires further efforts to be
utilized as an alternative QC architecture based on the
solution of the challenges and open issues listed as fol-
lows. The provided system design is valid for other parti-
cles including photons for optical QC setups or molecules
for molecular computing architectures for next genera-
tion nanoscale communication and computing systems.
The open issues are the following:
1. The formal mathematical proof for the decision of
SDA solution existence, i.e., k?, depending on mod-
els of ~c, ~d, H and Aj for j ? [0, N?1] with a metric
for fluctuations compared with the other values in
interval 1 ? k ? M .
2. Defining the set of SDA problems formally whose
solutions are achieved and not possible to achieve
by a specific QPC set-up.
3. Providing the class of problems that QPC can solve
exactly or provide an approximation to solutions of
NP-hard or NP-intermediate problems [16].
4. Mapping from a target SDA problem to physical
set-up parameters by utilizing highly complicated
expressions of ~c, ~d, H and Aj for j ? [0, N ? 1]
described in Appendix A.
5. Designing the best classical frequency estimation
method operating on samples of I? by analyzing the
state-of-the art polynomial solutions such as the
ones reviewed in [20].

6. Experimental verification of the proposed system
set-up and extension for other particles including
photons and molecules by providing easier system
design and utilization in molecular and nanoscale
computing architectures.
7. As the planes are getting closer, accuracy of as-
suming tj,j+1 constant for all paths on jth plane
decreases, and appears as an error term.
8. Gaussian slit approximation for particles should
be verified experimentally and the width ?j for
j ? [1, N ? 1] should be determined experimentally
by tuning the value for a fixed slit width giving
the smallest error in periodicity estimation. The
photonic implementations with significantly thin
planes, e.g., graphene or similar 2D materials, are
candidates to form perfect Gaussian slits.
IX. CONCLUSION
In this article, a simple and low complexity quantum
computing architecture is presented by utilizing multi-
plane and multi-slit quantum superposition interference
and Feynman path integral formalism. The proposed sys-
tem denoted by QPC achieves to find solutions to HSPs
and provides theoretical framework promising solution
steps for some set of NP-hard SDA problems. Simulation
results provide polynomial time solutions to the specifi-
cally designed simple SDA problems. QPC system is a
low complexity, low cost and simple QC architecture op-
erating at the room temperature for finding polynomial
solutions to some set of problems requiring exponentially
complex time and memory resources. QPC is a competi-
tive alternative to existing QC systems having significant
challenges in terms of complexity and the performance.
