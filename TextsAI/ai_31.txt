Linking Generative Adversarial Learning and Binary Classification

Abstract
In this note, we point out a basic link between generative adversarial (GA) training and binary classi-
fication – any powerful discriminator essentially computes an (f -)divergence between real and generated
samples. The result, repeatedly re-derived in decision theory, has implications for GA Networks (GANs),
providing an alternative perspective on training f -GANs by designing the discriminator loss function.
1 Generating a Distribution
Imagine we are given real data with distribution Pr(x) over a feature space X , and wish to learn a distribution
Pg(x) that is as “close” as possible to Pr. Closeness will be measured by some divergence function D(·, ·)
between probability distributions. So the generator is typically solving
P ?g = arg inf
Pg
D(Pg , Pr) (1)
where Pg is in some class of distributions specified by the generator. This manuscript considers D(·, ·) to be
an f -divergence:
Definition 1. f-divergence. For any convex f(t) with f(1) = 0, define the f -divergence of Pg to Pr
1 as
Df (Pg, Pr) = Ex?Pr
[
f
(
Pg(x)
Pr(x)
)]
Here we examine the method of highlighting differences between Pr and Pg by feeding them to a binary
classifier (discriminator) with corresponding labels y = ±1, in equal proportion as for a typical GAN setup,
so that the data input to the discriminator are assigned a positive label if they are real data:
p := Pr (y = +1) =
1
2
, Pr(x) = Pr (x | y = +1) , Pg(x) = Pr (x | y = ?1)
Recall that any two-class loss function can equivalently be written in terms of partial losses ?+(g) and ??(g);
these are the losses with respect to true labels ±1 respectively, as a function of the label prediction g.
The discrimination problem is to find a function h in some model class H that attempts to minimize
some loss on average over the data:
inf
h?H
E(x,y) [?(y, h(x))] (2)
The generative view of binary classification [RW11] writes this in terms of the class-conditional distributions
Pr (x | y = ±1):
Ey [?(y, h(x))] = Pr (x, y = +1) ?+(h(x)) + Pr (x, y = ?1) ??(h(x))
= pPr (x | y = +1) ?+(h(x)) + (1? p) Pr (x | y = ?1) ??(h(x))
=
1
2
[Pr(x)?+(h(x)) + Pg(x)??(h(x))] (3)
1Note that Df (Pg, Pr) need not be positive.

The optimization problem (2) is standard in binary classification. Typically, H is chosen to be a fairly
rich class of deep binary classifiers. This means that its performance is close to the Bayes risk, i.e. the
minimum risk over measurable functions infh E(x,y) [?(y, h(x))] [RW11]. So the excess risk
?(H) := inf
h?H
E(x,y) [?(y, h(x))]? inf
h
E(x,y) [?(y, h(x))]
is small.
2 Main Result
Theorem 2. Take any loss function ?± and any model class H. Define f(s) := sup
?
(??+(?) ? s??(?)).
This is a maximum of linear functions, so it is convex. Then
inf
h?H
E(x,y) [?(y, h(x))] = ?
1
2
Df(Pg , Pr) + ?(H)
Changing the model class H only changes the second term of Thm. 2. Therefore, when H is rich enough
that the excess risk ?(H) is small, the loss function ? of the discrimination problem corresponds almost
exactly to an f -divergence.
2.1 GA Training Solves the Generation Problem with f-Divergences
Revisiting (1), to find P ?g to be “close” to Pr under some f -divergence Df , one could solve
P ?g = arg inf
Pg
Df (Pg, Pr) = arg sup
Pg
[?Df(Pg, Pr)] = arg sup
Pr(x|y=?1)
[
inf
h?H
E(x,y) [?(y, h(x))] ? ?(H)
]
? arg sup
Pr(x|y=?1)
[
inf
h?H
E(x,y) [?(y, h(x))]
]
So the adversarial game interaction between the generator and discriminator emerges as the solution to the
generation problem for powerful enough discriminators, for any ?,H.
2.2 Examples
Table 1 shows the correspondence between ? and f for several common f -divergences. Similar lists can be
found in [NWJ09, RW11].
In the GA setup, the variable s is always a function over the data space X . The maximizing ? in
arg sup? (??+(?) ? s??(?)) is a function of s; as a function of the data ?(x), it is the optimal discriminator
h?(x) = h?(s(x)).
3 Related Work
The most related work to this manuscript is the f -GAN approach of [NCT16], to our knowledge. This solves
the same problem of minimizing the f -divergence to the true distribution, but by changing the discriminator
objective from the binary classification risk, (in contrast to Thm. 2 which just interprets the risk). The
key fact is that a convex function f has a well-defined convex conjugate function f? such that f(u) =
supt?R [tu? f
?(t)], so that the following is true2:
Df(Pr , Pg) = Ex?Pg
[

[NCT16] use this bound from [NWJ10]. It is quite tight when H is rich, exactly when Thm. 2 is strong,
though the order of the arguments is switched. 3
More broadly, since the original GAN paper [GPAM+14], the GA approach has enjoyed a string of recent
empirical successes with very rich model classes H [RMC15, BSM17], in accordance with Thm. 2.
4 Summary
The correspondences here fundamentally link generative adversarial training and the generation problem,
and most are well known in decision theory. However, within the GAN literature they do not appear well
known and lack references, which we address in this note.

3Note that (4) puts the modeled (generated) distribution in the second argument rather than the first; the two orderings
are related by Csisza?r duality [RW11]. Our proof of Theorem 2 can be followed to prove an exact analogue of Theorem 2
viewing the discriminator risk as Df (Pr , Pg) with the arguments interchanged as in (4). The analogue result only differs in the
definition of the convex function generating the divergence, which is sup? (???(?)? s?+(?)) instead of f as defined in Thm.
2. In this manuscript, we follow the convention of taking the real distribution to be the second argument with respect to which
we measure the “excess description length” of using Pg.
