in Multi-Antenna Small-Cell Networks

Abstract—Previous works on cache-enabled small-cell net-
works (SCNs) with probabilistic caching often assume that
each user is connected to the nearest small base station (SBS)
among all that have cached its desired content. The user may,
however, suffer strong interference from other SBSs which do
not cache the desired content but are geographically closer than
the serving SBS. In this work, we investigate this issue by
deploying multiple antennas at each SBS. We first propose a
user-centric SBS clustering model where each user chooses its
serving SBS from a cluster of closest SBSs with a fixed cluster
size only. Two beamforming schemes are considered. One is
coordinated beamforming, where each SBS uses zero-forcing (ZF)
beamformer to null out the interference within its coordination
cluster. The other is uncoordinated beamforming, where each
SBS simply applies matched-filter (MF) beamformer. Using tools
from stochastic geometry, we obtain tractable expressions for
the successful transmission probability of a typical user for both
schemes in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. Tight
approximations in closed-form expressions are also obtained.
We then formulate and solve the optimal probabilistic caching
problem to maximize the successful transmission probability.
Numerical results reveal interesting insights on the choices of ZF
and MF beamforming to maximize the performance in cache-
enabled SCNs.
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent decades, mobile data traffic has grown rapidly due
to the proliferation of mobile devices, which imposes heavy
pressure on the limited backhaul link in cellular networks.
Caching popular contents in small base stations (SBSs) at off-
peak time is a promising way to alleviate the backhaul pressure
by avoiding repetitive transmissions in the backhaul link. It
can also improve user-perceived experience due to the reduced
transmission latency.
Many prior works have studied cache-enabled small-cell
networks (SCNs) with various caching strategies and opti-
mization objectives. Thus far, there are two commonly used
caching strategies. One is for each SBS to cache the most
popular contents as in [1], [2], which is suitable for networks
where each user can only be associated with its nearest SBS.
The other is for each SBS to cache contents randomly with
probabilities to be optimized as in [3]–[6]. In particular, the
work [3] formulates and solves the probabilistic cache place-
ment problem to maximize the cache hit rate using stochastic
geometry. It shows that caching the contents randomly with
the optimized probabilities has significant gain over caching
the most popular contents since each user can be covered by
multiple SBSs. However, when a user is not served by the
nearest SBS, the strong interference from the closer SBSs will
severely harm the received signal-to-interference ratio (SIR).
It is thus crucial to study interference management schemes
with probabilistic caching in SCNs. Many works have studied
the transmission schemes to solve this problem to enhance
the performance in cache-enabled networks. The authors in
[7] make an initial attempt to apply joint transmission and
successive interference cancelation (SIC) in cache-enabled
SCNs and study the tradeoff between transmission diversity
and content diversity. The authors in [8] employ zero-forcing
(ZF) beamforming to null interference and optimize the cache
placement for maximizing the success probability and area
spectral efficiency.
In this paper, we aim to exploit the benefits of multiple
antennas in cache-enabled SCNs when probabilistic caching is
adopted. Multiple antennas can be used to cancel interference
from neighboring cells with SBS coordination, or only to
strengthen the effective channel gain of desired signals without
SBS coordination, both yielding significant increase in the
received SINR. The study in [7] is limited to disjoint SBS
clustering and the analysis only focuses on a user located
at the cluster center. In this work, we consider a typical
user and employ user-centric dynamic SBS clustering for
user association in cache-enabled SCNs. Each user is allowed
to associate with its nearest multiple SBSs and each SBS
caches files independently with identical probabilities. We
study the performance in cache-enabled SCNs with ZF and
matched-filter (MF) beamformings. The main contributions are
summarized as follows.
• We propose a user-centric dynamic SBS clustering
model in cache-enabled multi-antenna SCNs with probabilistic
caching, where each user is allowed to access one of the
SBSs within its cluster. Each SBS adopts ZF-based coordi-
nated beamforming when transmission coordination is allowed
within the SBS cluster or MF beamforming otherwise.
• We obtain the closed-form (approximate) upper and lower
bounds of the coverage probability of a typical user in both
MF and ZF beamforming scenarios in the high signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) region using tools from stochastic geometry.
Our analysis extends that in [9] by allowing each user to be
associated with the k-th nearest SBS, with k being any integer
not larger than the cluster size.
• We formulate an optimal probabilistic caching problem
to maximize the probability that the typical user successfully
receives its requested file locally from the SBSs within its
cluster. The problem is shown to be convex and solved by
2
Lagrangian method. Closed-form optimal cache solutions are
also obtained.
• Extensive numerical results reveal that the optimal prob-
abilistic caching strategy has a gain over the most popular
caching. More importantly, it is found that when the number
of antennas is the same as the cluster size, MF outperforms
ZF. While when the number of antennas is larger than the
cluster size, ZF performs better.
Notations: This paper uses bold-face lower-case h for
vectors and bold-face uppercase H for matrices. HH is the
conjugate transpose of H and H† is the left pseudo-inverse of
H, defined as H† = (HHH)?1HH . We use Im to denote a
m×m identity matrix and 01×m denotes a 1×m zero vector.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a cache-enabled multi-antenna SCN, where the
locations of SBSs are modeled as a homogenous Poisson point
process (HPPP) ?b = {di ? R2, ?i ? N+} with intensity ?b.
Each SBS is equipped with L antennas. The intensity of users
is ?u and each user is equipped with a single antenna. We
assume that ?u ? ?b so that the network is fully loaded with
each SBS serving one user at a time.
We consider a file library F = {f1, f2, · · · , fN}, where
N is the total number of files. All files are assumed to
have the same normalized size of 1 for analytical tractability.
The popularity of files follows the Zipf distribution with the
popularity of file fn given by:
pn =
1/n?
?N
j=1 1/j
?
, n = 1, 2, . . . , N, (1)
where ? ? 0 is the skewnesss parameter. Each SBS has a local
cache that can store up to M files with M < N . We adopt
the probabilistic caching strategy, where each SBS caches file
fn with probability bn independently. Due to the cache size
constraint and probability property, we have the constraints:
?N
n=1 bn ? M and 0 ? bn ? 1 for n = 1, 2, . . . , N . Note that
a practical cache placement strategy with given probabilities
can be found in [3].
A. User Association Strategy
In this work, each user is allowed to choose its serving
SBS from a cluster of K SBSs that are closest to the user,
where K ? 2 is a positive integer. We shall refer to the K
closest SBSs of each user as the user-centric SBS cluster with
size of K . When a user submits a file request, the nearest
SBS within the cluster that have cached the requested file will
serve the user. If none of the K SBSs in the cluster caches
the requested file, a macro base station (MBS) will download
the file from the core network via backhaul link and then
transmit it to the user. By such user-centric SBS clustering, the
plane is tessellated into K-th order Voronoi regions, denoted
as VK(d1, · · · , dK). The K-th order Voronoi cell associated
with a set of K points {d1, · · · , dK} is the region that all the
points in this region are closer to these K points than to any
other point of ?b, i.e., VK(d1, · · · , dK) = {d ? R2| ?Kk=1
{?d? dk? ? ?d? di?}, di ? ?b\{d1, d2, · · · , dK}}.
Without loss of generality, we focus on a typical user u0
which is located at the origin, and can choose to connect to
any of the SBSs in the K-th order Voronoi cell that it belongs
to, denoted as C = {d1, d2, · · · , dK}. The distance between
u0 and the k-th nearest SBS dk is rk. As assumed earlier, the
user intensity is much larger than SBS intensity, and hence
the network is fully loaded with all the SBSs being active. We
consider an interference-limited network where the noise can
be neglected. Hence, the received signal of u0 when associated
with the k-th nearest SBS dk, for k = 1, 2, . . . ,K is given by:
y0 = r
??
2
k hk0wkxk +
?
j??b\{dk}
r
??
2
j hj0wjxj , (2)
where the channel is assumed to have both small-scale fading,
denoted as hi0, and large-scale fading r
??
2
i . The small-
scale fading is modeled as Rayleigh fading, i.e., hi0 ?
CN (01×L, IL) and the large-scale fading r?
?
2
i follows the
distance-dependent power law model with ? > 2 being the
path loss exponent. xi and wi ? CL×1 denote the transmit
signal and the associated beamformer vector, respectively.
We consider two types of beamforming design in each SBS.
One is uncoordinated, where each SBS applies an MF based
beamforming independently to maximize the effective channel
gain of its own user. The other is coordinated, where the K
SBSs in each K-th order Voronoi cell apply ZF beamforming
coordinately so that the intra-cluster interference can be nulled
out completely. This requires that the number of antennas at
each SBS should not be smaller than the cluster size, i.e.
L ? K . Note that since we consider a user-centric SBS
clustering for coordinated beamforming, all the other K ? 1
users involved in the coordination must also locate in the same
K-th order Voronoi cell as the typical user. This requirement
is enforced to justify the typicality of the typical user in our
analysis and it can be easily satisfied given that the user
intensity is much larger than the SBS intensity. However, this
requirement is not needed for the uncoordinated beamforming.
B. Matched-Filter Beamforming
When the typical user is associated with SBS dk ? C, the
MF beamforming vector wk is given by:
wk,mf =
h
H
k0
?hk0?
. (3)
Since each SBS serves its own user independently, the
interference for the typical user comes from all SBSs except
the serving SBS dk in the network. Thus, based on (2), the
SIR for u0 is given by:
SIRk,mf =
gk,mf · r??k
?
j??b\{dk} gj,mf · r
??
j
, (4)
where gk,mf = ?hk0?2 is the effective channel gain of the
desired signal and it follows the Gamma distribution with
shape parameter L and scale parameter 1, denoted as gk,mf ?
?(L, 1), and gj,mf = |hj0wj,mf|2 is the effective channel gain
of the undesired signal and follows the exponential distribution
with parameter 1, denoted as gj,mf ? exp(1) [10].
3
C. Zero-Forcing Beamforming
In the ZF beamforming vector design, the K?1 intra-cluster
interferences of the typical user are completely nulled [9]. To
ensure the feasibility, we assume L ? K as mentioned earlier.
The beamforming vector is given by:
wk,zf =
(IL ?HH†)hTk0
?(IL ?HH†)hTk0?
, (5)
where H = [hTk1,h
T
k2, · · · ,hTk(K?1)] is the channel between
the serving SBS dk of the typical user and the K ? 1 users
served by the other K?1 SBSs in the coordination group. By
(5), the interference caused by SBS dk to all other K?1 users
in the cluster is canceled. The other K?1 SBSs from C adopt
the same ZF beamforming strategy. Thus, the interference for
the typical user only comes from the SBSs out of the cluster.
Therefore, the SIR for the typical user is given by:
SIRk,zf =
gk,zf · r??k
?
j??b\C gj,zf · r
??
j
, (6)
where gk,zf = |hk0wk,zf|2 is the effective channel gain of the
desired signal and follows gk,zf ? ?(L?K+1, 1), and gj,zf =
|hj0wj,zf|2 is the effective channel gain of the undesired signal
and follows gj,zf ? exp(1) [10].
Before concluding this section, we would like to remark that
ZF beamforming requires each SBS to know the channel state
information (CSI) of all the K users in the cluster, therefore
extra signalling overhead is needed. On the other hand, MF
beamforming only require each SBS to know the CSI of its
only user.
III. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
In this paper, we use the successful transmission probability
(STP) of the typical user as the performance metric.
The successful transmission probability, denoted as
Psuc(K), is defined as the probability that the typical user can
successfully receive its requested file locally from the cluster
of K closest SBSs without resorting to the core network. A
file can be successful transmitted locally if and only if it
is cached and the received SIR exceeds a given SIR target.
The probability that the received SIR exceeds a SIR target
is called the coverage probability. Denote P kcov(K) as the
coverage probability of the typical user served by the k-th
(k = 1, 2 . . .K) nearest SBS in the cluster and it is given by:
P kcov(K) = P [SIRk ? ?], (7)
where ? is the given SIR threshold.
Therefore, the successful transmission probability is given
by:
Psuc(K) =
N
?
n=1
pn
K
?
k=1
bn(1? bn)k?1P kcov(K), (8)
where pn is the request probability of file fn and bn is the
cache probability of file fn.
Our goal is to analyze Psuc(K) with MF and ZF beam-
formings, respectively, then optimize the cache probabilities
for both cases and finally compare their performances.
In the rest of this section, we analyze the coverage probabil-
ity P kcov(K) in both MF and ZF beamforming cases. Note that
the works [9], [11], [12] have studied the SIR distribution in
multi-antenna networks with coordinated beamforming using
stochastic geometry tools. In particular, [11] obtains the char-
acteristic function of other-cell interference when both base
stations and users are equipped with multiple antennas. The
work [12] obtains a tractable and approximation expression of
the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF)
of SIR when the user is served by the nearest SBS only.
The work [9] further obtains closed-form upper and lower
bounds of the CCDF of SIR. Our analysis differs from the
above references in that each user is allowed to be served
by the k-th nearest SBS, for k = 1, 2, . . . ,K , which (to our
best knowledge, has not been studied before in the literature)
makes our problem more challenging and more general.
A. Coverage Probability with MF Beamforming
Lemma 1: The coverage probability of the typical user
served by the k-th nearest SBS with MF beamforming is:
P kcov,mf(K) = Erk
[
L?1
?
i=0
(??rk?)i

where Ir =

j , LIr (s) = E[e?sIr ] is the
Laplace transform of Ir given by:
LIr (s) =

)k?1
× exp
(
?2??b

rk
sr??
1 + sr??
rdr
)
, (10)
and L(i)Ir (s) is the i-th order derivative of LIr (s).
Proof: See Appendix A.
With the expression (9), we still need to obtain the expec-
tation over rk. The pdf of rk is given in Lemma 2.
Lemma 2 ( [13]): Given a HPPP in the 2-dimensional
plane with intensity ?b, the distance Rk of the k-th nearest
point to the origin follows the generalized Gamma distribution:
fRk(r) =
2
(
?b?r
2
)k
r?(k)
exp
(
??b?r2
)
. (11)
With Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, we can get a tractable expres-
sion of the coverage probability. In the following, we provide
more compact forms to bound the coverage probability.
Theorem 1: The coverage probability of the typical user
served by the k-th nearest SBS using MF beamforming is
bounded as:
P k,lcov,mf(K) ? P kcov,mf(K) ? P k,ucov,mf(K), (12)

the incomplete Beta function and B

x?1(1 ?
u)y?1du is the complementary incomplete Beta function.
Proof: See Appendix B.
In the special cases with L = 1 (single antenna), the
upper and lower bounds coincide and hence give the exact
expression. In addition, if ? = 4, this expression can be written
as a closed form.
Corollary 1: The coverage probability of the typical user
served by the k-th nearest SBS in the single-antenna network
with ? = 4 is given by:
P kcov,mf(K) =
(
1???arcsin 1?
1+?
)k?1
(
1 +
?
?arccos 1?
1+?
)k
. (17)
In the special case, when the user is served by its nearest
SBS, e.g., k = 1, (17) reduces to the results given in [14,
Theorem 2].
B. Coverage Probability with ZF Beamforming
Lemma 3: The coverage probability of the typical user
served by the k-th nearest SBS with ZF beamforming is given
by:
P kcov,zf(K) = Erk,rK
[
L?K
?
i=0
(??rk?)i

where Ir =

j and its Laplace transform is
given by:
LIr (s) = exp
(
?2??b
? ?
rK
sr??
1 + sr??
rdr
)
. (19)
The proof of lemma 3 is similar to Appendix A, so we omit
it here. Notice that the expectation in (18) is not only over rk,
but also over rK . Thus, we need to know the joint probability
density function (pdf) of rk and rK . The pdf of rK is given
in Lemma 2, we next focus on the pdf of rk conditioned on
rK .
Lemma 4 ( [15]): Consider K points randomly located in
a 2-dimensional circle of radius rK centered at the origin
according to the uniform distribution, then the distance Rk
from the origin to the k-th nearest point follows the distribution
given by:
fRk|RK (rk|rK) =
2rk
r2KB(K ? k, k)
(
r2k
r2K
)k?1 (

)K?k?1
,
(20)
where B(x, y) denotes the Beta function given by B(x, y) =
? 1
0
tx?1(1? t)y?1dt.
Thus, the joint pdf of rk and rK can be obtained as:
fRk,RK (rk, rK) = fRk|RK (rk|rK)fRK (rK)
=
4(?b?)

?(K ? k)?(k)rkrK(r

k?1
× (r2K ? r2k)K?k?1 exp
(

.
(21)
With Lemma 3 and Lemma 4, we can obtain a tractable
expression for the coverage probability. More compact forms
of the approximate coverage probability bounds are obtained
in the following theorem.
Theorem 2: The coverage probability of the typical user
served by the k-th nearest SBS with ZF beamforming can
be approximately bounded as:

The approximate upper and lower bounds coincide when
L = K . Furthermore, when ? = 4, they can be written in a
closed form.
Corollary 2: The approximate coverage probability of the
typical user served by the k-th nearest SBS using ZF beam-
forming with L = K and ? = 4 is given by:
P kcov,zf(K) ?

Proof: See Appendix C.
When the user is served by the nearest SBS, e.g., k = 1,
(25) reduces to the results given in [9, Eqn (28)].
As we shall demonstrate numerically in Section V-A, the
upper bounds (13) and (23) are very tight. Therefore, we shall
use them as approximate coverage probabilities for caching
optimization.

Lemma 5: The problem P1 is convex for both MF and ZF
beamforming, with the P kcov(K) expressed in both the exact
forms (9), (18) and the approximate forms (13), (23).
Proof: See Appendix D.
By using KKT condition, the optimal solution of P1 satisfies
the condition as follows.
Theorem 3: The optimal cache probabilities of P1 satisfy
bn(µ
?) = min (1, wn(µ

where µ? ? 0 is the optimal dual variable satisfying the cache
size constraint (27) and wn(µ

To obtain the optimal cache strategy, we should find the
optimal dual variable µ? by replacing (28) into the cache size
constraint
?N
n=1 bn(µ
?) = M . It is observed that bn(µ) is
a decreasing function respect to µ. Thus, the sum of bn(µ)
is also decreasing respect to µ. Therefore, we can use the
bisection method to find the optimal µ?.
V. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, we first validate the tightness of the ap-
proximate coverage probability in both MF and ZF cases by
simulations. Next, we analyze the effects of number of anten-
nas, and Zipf parameter on STP with optimal probabilistic
caching (OPC) and compare the performance between ZF

(MPC) is given in numerical results. Finally, the optimal cache
probabilities are proposed in both MF and ZF cases.
Simulations are performed in a square area of 4000× 4000
m2. Unless otherwise stated, the simulation parameters are
set as follows: SBS intensity ?b = 5 × 10?5/m2, path loss
exponent ? = 4, number of total files N = 100, cache size
M = 10, SIR target ? = 0dB and Zipf parameter ? = 0.9.
A. Validation of Analytical Results
From Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, we observe that the simulation and
analytical results of the coverage probability match well for
both MF and ZF beamforming. It is also seen that (13) and
(23) are very tight. As such, we shall use them to approximate
the coverage probabilities of the MF and ZF beamforming in
problem P1 to find the optimal cache probabilities.
B. Number of antennas
Fig. 3 shows the successful transmission probability with
the optimized caching probabilities at different number of
antennas. It is seen that multiple-antenna cache-enabled system
has a significant gain compared to the single-antenna system.
When the cluster size K is fixed, increasing the number of
antennas increases the successful transmission probability for
both MF and ZF beamforming but the gain diminishes as L
grows. It is also seen that when L > K (e.g. L = 3, 4),
ZF beamforming always outperforms MF beamforming at all
the considered SIR thresholds. Otherwise when L = K , MF
beamforming performs better than ZF beamforming at most
SIR threshold (e.g. ? < 10dB) and they are almost the same
only at high SIR threshold (e.g. ? > 10dB). This is because
when the number of antennas is the same as the cluster
size, the effective channel gain of the desired signal with ZF
beamforming is much smaller than that of MF beamforming
although the former suffers less interference. However, when
L is larger than K , the SBS has enough spatial dimensions
to null out the intra-cluster interference and strengthen the
effective channel gain of the desired signals simultaneously.
Therefore, ZF outperforms MF.
C. Zipf Parameter
In Fig. 4, it is observed STP grows with Zipf parameter ?
becomes larger. This is because larger ? means few popular
files are requested with a larger probability. Besides, it results
that the performance of MPC goes closer to that of OPC when
? grows. When ? > 1.8, OPC performs almost identically to
MPC. Moreover, it is observed that the gap between ZF and
MF in OPC becomes smaller when ? increases. This is because
that the coverage probability of the user not served by the
nearest SBS in ZF is larger than that in MF. For small ?, the file
popularity distribution is more like uniform distribution, which
causes that SBSs prefer to cache more number of different files
and users have a larger probability to connect to farther SBSs.
In this case, ZF can make a better utilization of the multiple
SBSs. While for large ?, OPC degenerates to MPC, and thus
users have a high probability to connect with the nearest SBS
and the performances of ZF and MF become closer.
D. Optimal Cache Strategy
Fig. 5 shows that at the high SIR target with ? = 10dB,
the typical user most likely can only connect to the nearest
SBS, and thus the most popular caching strategy is almost
optimal. When the SIR target is small with ? = ?10dB, the
typical user can be served by farther SBSs. Therefore, caching
more number of different files can increase the successful
transmission probability. The optimal cache solutions in MF
is closer to MPC compared to ZF since the users not served
by the nearest SBS in MF case suffers strong interference and
thus users are more willing to connect to the nearest SBS.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we focus on the performance of ZF and
MF beamformings in cache-enabled multi-antenna SCNs.
Tractable and closed-form approximate expressions of the suc-
cessful transmission probability in both MF and ZF cases are
obtained by using stochastic geometry tools. We then formu-
late the optimal probabilistic caching problem for maximizing
the successful transmission probability, which is proven to be
a convex optimization. We solve this problem and obtain the
closed-form optimal cache solutions. We numerically analyze
the effects of the number of antennas and Zipf parameter on
the successful transmission probability and make comparisons
between ZF and MF beamformings. Numerical results also
reveal that ZF outperforms MF when the number of antennas
is larger than the cluster size and MF performs better when
the number of antennas is the same as the cluster size.

follows from the derivative property of the Laplace transform:

The interference Ir consists of two parts, the interference I1
from the k?1 SBSs closer to u0 than the serving SBS dk and
the interference I2 from the SBSs farther than dk. Therefore,
the Laplace transform of interference LIr (s) can be given by
the product of LI1(s) and LI2(s), which is under the condition
that the distance between the k-th nearest SBS and the typical
rk is given.
The Laplace transform of the I1 is given by:

where (a) follows from that gj,mf are iid exponential random
variables with parameter 1 and they are independent with the
HPPP ?b. For the step (b), since the locations of K ? 1 BSs
are iid and uniformly distributed in the circle B(0, rk). Thus,
the pdf of the distance between these BSs and the typical user
is given by:
fR(r) =
{
2r

. (32)
For the interference I2, the Laplace transform can be written

where the last step follows from the probability generating
functional (PGFL) of the HPPP.
APPENDIX B
The proof relies on the following Lemma 5.
Lemma 6 (Alzer’s Inequality [16], [17]): If Z is a random
variable following the Gamma distribution with shape param-
eter T and scale parameter 1, denoted as Z ? ?(T, 1), the
cumulative distribution function (CDF) FZ(z) = P [Z ? z] is
bounded by:
(1? e??z)T ? FZ(z) ? (1? e?z)T , (34)
where ? = (T !)?
1
T .
From Lemma 5, it is observed that the upper bound can be
obtained by setting ? = 1 if the expression of the lower bound
with parameter ? is known.
Thus, we only need to focus on the upper bound of the
coverage probability. The upper bound for the CCDF of the
Gamma random variable Z can be written as
FZ(z) = P [Z ? z] ? 1? (1? e??z)T
=
T
?
i=1
(
T
i
)
(?1)i+1e??zi. (35)
Therefore, the upper bound of the coverage probability is
given by:
P kcov,mf(K) = Erk,Ir [P [gk,mf ? ?r?k Ir] |rk, Ir]
?
L

l=1

(?1)l+1Erk [LIr (??r?k l)|rk] . (36)
where ? = (L!)?

L .
Then, before simplifying the expression of the coverage
probability upper bound, we make some mathematical trans-
forms of the Laplace transform of the interference Ir.

(37)
where the last step follows that first replacing s?

? r with u,
then replacing 11+u?? with v.
Therefore, the Laplace transform in (36) can be written as:
LIr (??r?k l) =

(

,
(38)
where ?1(?, ?, ?, l) and exp(???br2k?2(?, ?, ?, l)) are de-
fined for expression simplicity and they are the Laplace
transform of intra-cluster and inter-cluster interference, respec-
tively. ?1(?, ?, ?, l) and ?2(?, ?, ?, l) are expressed as:
?1(?, ?, ?, l, k) =
[

Then we need to calculate the expectation of LIr (??r?k l)
over rk . It is observed that only the inter-cluster interference
is related to rk. Therefore, evaluating the expectation of
exp(???br2k?2(?, ?, ?, l)) is enough.

and step (b) follows from the Gamma distribution property

Therefore, we can obtain the upper bound of the coverage

By setting ? = 1, the lower bound can be obtained directly,
which completes the proof.

With the similar methods used in Appendix B, we can
obtain the upper bound of the coverage probability in the ZF
beamforming case.

where the expectation is over rk and rK because the distance
of the k-th nearest and the K-th nearest BSs are both random
variables. Ir is the inter-cluster interference and its Laplace
transform is similar to the LI2 (s) in the MF beamforming
case. The only difference is to replace rk in (33) with rK .
LIr (s) = exp
[
?2??b

. (46)
Replace s with ??r?k l and introduce a geometric parameter
?k =

LIr (??r?k l) = exp

(47)
where the last step follows from the variable change

From (45) and (47), we find that we need to calculate the
expectation over ?k and rK , rather than over rk and rK . Thus,
we first calculate the expectation of (47) over rK .

Therefore, the upper bound and lower bound can be ex-
pressed as

To obtain the expectation above over ?k, we first need to
know the pdf of ?k. Utilizing the joint pdf of rk and rK given
in (21), we can derive the CDF of ?k =

where the last step also follows from the random variable

we plug this into (51) and (52), the proof is completed.
APPENDIX D
Before proving the optimization problem P1 is convex, we
first need to prove that the coverage probability P kcov(K) is a
non-increasing function respect to k. It is easy to understand
this since the SIR for the user served by the farther SBS
is lower, which causes the lower coverage probability. Then
we prove this conclusion mathematically in both ZF and MF
beamforming cases.
We first focus on the analytical results (9) and (18). In the
ZF case, the Laplace transform of the interference Ir is given
by:
LIr (s) = exp
(
?2??b
? ?
rK
sr??
1 + sr??
rdr
)
, (59)
For ease of illustration, we let
X(s) = ?2??b
? ?
rK
sr??
1 + sr??
rdr. (60)
Thus, the i-th order derivative of the Laplace transform can
be written as
L(i)Ir (s) =
i?1
?
m=0
(
i? 1
m
)
L(m)Ir (s)X
(i?m)(s). (61)
It is easy to find the even order derivative of X(s) is
positive while the odd order derivative is negative. Besides,
it is observed that
L(1)Ir (s) = LIr (s)X
(1)(s) ? 0, (62)
L(2)Ir (s) = LIr (s)X
(2)(s) + L(1)Ir (s)X
(1)(s) ? 0. (63)
Therefore, we then we use mathematical induction to prove
that the even order derivative of LIr (s) is positive and the odd
order derivative is negative. First, we initialize k = 1. From
(62) and (63), we have L(2k)Ir (s) ? 0 and L
(2k?1)
Ir
(s) ? 0.
Then, we assume L(2k)Ir (s) ? 0 and L
(2k?1)
Ir
(s) ? 0 for any
integer k = 2, 3, · · ·n. Next, we focus on k = n+1 and have:
L(2k)Ir (s) = L
(2n+2)
Ir
(s)
=
2n+1
?
m=0
(
2n+ 1
m
)
L(m)Ir (s)X
(2n+2?m)(s) ? 0 (64)
L(2k?1)Ir (s) = L
(2n+1)
Ir
(s)
=
2n
?
m=0
(
2n
m
)
L(m)Ir (s)X
(2n+1?m)(s) ? 0 (65)
Therefore, we conclude that L(2k)Ir (s) ? 0 and L
(2k?1)
Ir
(s) ? 0
for any integer k. Then we define a function G(s) as
G(s) =
L?K
?
i=0
(?s)i
i!
L(i)Ir (s) (66)
and we have
G
?
(s) =
L?K
?
i=0
(?1)i
i!
[isi?1L(i)Ir (s) + s
iL(i+1)Ir (s)] (67)
= (?1)L?KsL?KL(L?K+1)Ir (s) ? 0 (68)
10
which means G(s) is non-increasing respect to s. Hence,
G(?r?k ) is a non-increasing function respect to rk. Since the
coverage probability is given by:
P kcov,zf(K) = Erk,rK [G(?r
?
k )]
=
? ?
0
? rK
0
G(?r?k )fRk,RK (rk, rK)drkdrK .
(69)
Then, we define a function A(k) represented the conditional
pdf of rk given in lemma 4 as: A(k) = fRk|RK (rk|rK). We
assume that the distance of the k-th nearest SBS and the k+1
nearest SBS are the same (rk = rk+1). Thus, we have
A(k + 1)
A(k)
=
(
K ? k ? 1
k
)(
r2k
r2K ? r2k
)
(70)
which is a increasing function respect to rk . When rk = 0, the
ratio equals to 0 and when rk = rK , we have
A(n+1)
A(n) = ?.
Therefore, there must exist a threshold D. When rk = rk+1 =
D, we have A(k+1)A(k) = 1. This means that the probability of
rk = D and rk+1 = D are the same. For the distance D1 < D,
we have P [rk = D1] > P [rk+1 = D1] since
A(k+1)
A(k) is a
increasing function respect to rk. For the distance D2 > D,
we have P [rk = D2] < P [rk+1 = D2]. Combining this with
G(?r?k ) is non-increasing respect to rk , we can conclude that
the coverage probability P kcov,zf(K) is a non-increasing func-
tion respect to k. For the MF beamforming case, the coverage
probability P kcov,mf(K) is also a non-increasing function respect
to k which can be proved easily.
While for the approximate coverage probability (13) and
(23), we try to proof they are also non-increasing function
respect to k.
In the ZF case, we define a non-negative random variable
I3 similar to the interference Ir and its Laplace transform is
given by:
LI3(s) = exp
(
?2??b
? ?
rk
sr??
1 + sr??
rdr
)
. (71)
Similar to (47), we have:
LI3
(
??(?krK)
?l

k

= exp
(
???br2K?2k(??l)

, (72)
Therefore, the approximate coverage probability in ZF case
can be written as:
P k,ucov,zf(K) =
L?K+1

(76)
Combining (74) and (76), we conclude that P k,ucov,zf(K) ?
P k+1,ucov,zf (K), which means P
k,u
cov,zf(K) is a non-increasing func-
tion respect to k.

which means P k,ucov,mf(K) is a non-increasing function respect

Therefore, we conclude that the coverage probability
P kcov(K) is a non-increasing function respect to k for exact and
approximate forms in both ZF and MF beamforming cases.
Utilizing the property of the coverage probability proved
above, the second order derivative of the objective function
respect to bn can be expressed as

? 0. (79)
where the first inequality follows from that P kcov(K) is non-
increasing respect to k and the last step follows from that
0 ? bn ? 1. Thus, the objective function is a concave function
and we want to maximize it. Besides, all constraints are linear.
Therefore, the proof is completed.
APPENDIX E
The Lagrangian function can be written as:
L(b1, b2, · · · , bN , µ) =
N

n=1

k=1
bn(1? bn)k?1P kcov(K)

, (80)
where u is the Lagrangian multiplier associated with the con-
straint (27). The partial derivative of the Lagrangian function
as:
L = ?L(b1, b2, · · · , bN , µ)
?bn
= pn
K
?
k=1
(1? bn)k?2(1 ? kbn)P kcov(K)? µ. (81)
By letting L = 0, we have
pn
K
?
k=1
(1 ? bn)k?2(1? kbn)P kcov(K) = µ (82)
It is easy to find that the left hand of (82) is a de-
creasing function respect to bn since the objective func-
tion is concave. Notice that we have the constraint 0 ?
bn ? 1. Thus, when bn = 1, µ has the minimum value:
pn
[
P 1cov(K)? P 2cov(K)
]
. While for bn = 0, it has the
maximum value: pn
?K
k=1 P
k
cov(K). Therefore, for a given
Lagrangian multiplier µ, combining this constraint and the
monotonic decreasing property of the equation (82), we find
that the solution of cache strategy bn(µ) can be given by
bn(µ) =

which can be rewritten as:
bn(µ) = min (1, wn(µ)) , (84)
where wn(µ) is the real and non-negative root of the function:
pn

?
k=1
[1? wn(µ)]k?2 [1? kwn(µ)]P kcov(K) = µ. (85)
For the optimal dual variable µ? which satisfies the cache
size constraint (27), we obtain the optimal cache strategy is
given by:
bn(µ
?) = min (1, wn(µ
?)) , (86)
which completes the proof.
