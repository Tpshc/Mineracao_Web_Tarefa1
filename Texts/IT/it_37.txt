Lower bounds on the lifting degree of
single-edge and multiple-edge QC-LDPC codes
by difference matrices
Farzane Amirzade and Mohammad-Reza Sadeghi
Abstract
In this paper, we define two matrices named as “difference matrices”, denoted by D and DD which
significantly contribute to achieve regular single-edge QC-LDPC codes with the shortest length and the
certain girth as well as regular and irregular multiple-edge QC-LDPC codes.
Making use of these matrices, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions to have single-edge
(m,n)-regular QC-LDPC codes with girth 6 by which we achieve all non-isomorphic codes with the
minimum lifting degree, N , for m = 4 and 5 ? n ? 11, and present an exponent matrix for each
minimum distance. We attain the necessary and sufficient conditions to have a Tanner graph with
girth 10. In this case we also provide a lower bound on the lifting degree which is tighter than the
existing bound. More important, for an exponent matrix whose first row and first column are all-zero,
we demonstrate that the non-existence of 8-cycles proves the non-existence of 6-cycles related to the
first row of the exponent matrix too. All non-isomorphic QC-LDPC codes with girth 10 and n = 5, 6
whose numbers are more than those presented in the literature are provided. For n = 7, 8 we decrease
the lifting degrees from 159 and 219 to 145 and 211, repectively. Moreover, necessary and sufficient
conditions to have (m,n)-regular QC-LDPC codes with girth 12 as well as a lower bound on the lifting
degree are achieved.
For multiple-edge category, for the first time a lower bound on the lifting degree for both regular and
irregular QC-LDPC codes with girth 6 is achieved. We analytically prove that if ~Bij is ij-th element of
an m×n exponent matrix B then by taking three values A = max{2

the minimum lifting degree is at least N = max{A,B,C}. We also demonstrate that the achieved
lower bounds on multiple-edge (4, n)-regular QC-LDPC codes with girth 6 are tight and the resultant
codes have shorter length compared to their counterparts in single-edge codes. Additionaly difference
matrices help to reduce the conditions of considering 6-cycles from seven states to five states. We obtain
multiple-edge (4, n)-regular QC-LDPC codes with girth 8 and n = 4, 6, 8 with the shortest length.

I. INTRODUCTION
Q
Uasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes (QC-LDPC codes) are an essential category of
LDPC codes that are preferred to other types of LDPC codes because of their favourably
practical and simple implementations. One of the most important representation of codes is
Tanner graph in which the length of the shortest cycles, girth, has been known to influence the
code performance. Since Tanner graphs with short cycles do not produce good results, lots of
efforts have been put into designing QC-LDPC codes with large girth.
There are two structures for constructing LDPC codes, algebraic-based and graph-theoretic-
based. Of the latter the most well-known methods are progressive edge growth (PEG) and
protograph-based methods. There is a large body of work devoted to the protograph-based QC-
LDPC code structures, some of which can be found in the reference section. Protograph itself
can be divided into two categories, single-edge and multiple-edge protographs. They are denoted
by a base matrix, Bptg, whose elements identify the type of the protograph. If all the entries of
Bptg are ones or zeros and the ones are substituted by N × N circulant permutation matrices
(CPMs) and zero elements by an N ×N zero matrix (ZM) then the null space of the resultant
parity-check matrix constructs a QC-LDPC code and the corresponding Bptg is referred to as
single-edge protograph. In [1] it is shown that if Bptg contains an all-one submatrix of size 2×3
or 3×2 then Tanner graph has 12-cycles. In QC-LDPC codes, parameter N stands for the lifting
degree. It is clear that the less the lifting degree is the shorter length QC-LDPC code is obtained.
In order to construct a parity-check matrix with a given lifting degree N all of 1-components
of Bptg are replaced by i; 0 ? i ? N ? 1. The obtained matrix is known as an exponent matrix
and replacing all of non-zero elements and zeros by CPMs or ZMs provides us with the parity-
check matrix. In [2], the authors claim to achieve all non-isomorphic fully connected single-edge

(3, n)-regular QC-LDPC codes with the minimum lifting degree for n = 4, . . . , 12 and girth 6,
for n = 4, . . . , 9 and girth 8, n = 4, 5, 6 and girth 10 and for n = 4, 5 and girth 12. To obtain
the results they make use of an exhaustive search and apply the well-known Fossorier’s Lemma.
There are also results for m = 3, 4, 5, 6 in [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8] and different girths. The lower
bounds obtained in [8] on the lifting degree of (m,n) regular QC-LDPC codes whose Tanner
graphs have girth 6, 8 and 10 are n, (m? 1)(n? 1) + 1 and n(n? 1)(m? 1) + 1, respectively.
In this paper we define two matrices named as difference matrices, D, and DD, from an
exponent matrix. One of the advantages of providing these matrices is a reduction in the
complexity of the search algorithm to obtain the minimum lifting degree that achieves a certain
girth. More importantly, it helps us to provide the necessary and sufficient condition for the
difference matrix of a QC-LDPC code to have a Tanner graph with girth 6. By making use of
these matrices we obtain all non-isomorphic fully connected single-edge (4,n) QC-LDPC codes
with the shortest length for 5 ? n ? 11. We also achieve their minimum distances and for each
minimum distance we present an exponent matrix. In addition, we investigate the conditions of
difference matrices to have a Tanner graph with girth 8. The obtained conditions contribute us
to prove the fact that if elements of the first row and the first column of the exponent matrix
are zeros then the non-existence of 8-cycles guarantees the non-existence of 6-cycles related to
the first row. This result expresses that if Tanner graph is free of 8-cycles then in order to have
a Tanner graph with girth 10 there is no need to check 3 × 3 submatrices that contain the first
all-zero row for considering the existence of 6-cycles. This consequence significantly reduces the
complexity of search. We apply the necessary and sufficient conditions of difference matrices on
(3, n) exponent matrices to have QC-LDPC codes with girth 10, where 4 ? n ? 8. We conclude
that the number of non-isomorphic codes obtained making use of difference matrices for n = 5
and n = 6 is 4 and 2, respectively. These numbers are more than those represnted in [2], which
are 3 and 1, respectively. However, in [2] it is claimed to obtain all non-isompprphic exponent
matrices by an efficient exhaustive search. The minimum lifting degrees in [4] for n = 7, 8 are
159 and 219, respectively, whereas applying difference matrices results in (3, n) QC-LDPC codes
with girth 10 and shorter length, in these cases N is 145 and 211, respectively. We also provide
analytical lower bounds for the lifting degree according to the girth. We demonstrate that for
(m,n) QC-LDPC codes whose Tanner graphs have girth 10 we have N ?
(

)
n(n?1)+1. Our
proposed lower bound acknowledges those lifting degrees obtained search-based in [2] for m = 3
and n = 37, 61, 91. Moreover our proposed lower bound improves the one in the literature. In

fact, our obtained lower bound is m
2
times as many as the one in [8], which is n(n?1)(m?1)+1.
We also consider all conditions of difference matrices to obtain (m,n) QC-LDPC codes with
girth 12 and present a lower bound on the lifting degree. We prove that if A is a set consisting of
the values obtained from the left side of equation in Fossorier’s Lemma for 6-cycle considerations
then N ? |A|+
(

n(n? 1) + 1.
Taking benefit of difference matrices we also achieve some results regarding to multiple-
edge QC-LDPC codes for both regular and irregular categories. We summarize them in the
following. According to our definition of difference matrices we prove that if B is the exponent
matrix of a multiple-edge QC-LDPC code of size m × n with girth 6 then by taking three
variables, A = max{2

~Bij |×| ~Bi?j |; i 6= i
?; i, i? ? {1, 2 . . . , m}} we show that the minimum lifting
degree is at least N = max{A,B,C}. By applying the result on (2, n) exponent matrices for
which | ~Bij| = 2 we have N ? 4n. For n = 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 we demonstrate the obtained lower
bounds are tight. Furthermore, in comparison with single-edge (4, 2n) QC-LDPC codes with
girth 6, the proposed multiple-edge QC-LDPC codes with girth 6 has shorter length. In order
to obtain a multiple-edge QC-LDPC code with girth 8, seven types of submatrices have to be
investigated. Thanks to difference matrices we decrease the investigation into five types and
making use of them we obtain multiple-edge (4, 4), (4,6) and (4,8) QC-LDPC codes with the
shortest length and girth 8.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents some basic notations. Section
III includes four subsections to consider the equations related to 2k-cycles, where k = 2, 3, 4, 5.
Section IV is related to multiple-edge QC-LDPC codes in both regular and irregular types. In
the last section we summarize our results.

by i right cyclic shifts of the first row and clearly the first row is a right cyclic shift of the
last row. If ~Bij = (?) then it is replaced by a zero matrix. The null space of the parity-
check matrix, H , which is presented in the following, provides us with a QC-LDPC code. Note
that, our definition of QC-LDPC codes covers both types of single-edge protograph codes and
multiple-edge protograph codes that are produced by lifting each edge of their corresponding

In single-edge protographs whose base matrices have elements of cardinality of at most 1, the
necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of cycles of length 2k is provided in [3].
This well-known result is our principle tool and we summarise it as follows.
If

i=0
(bmini ? bmini+1 ) = 0 mod N, (3)
where nk = n0, mi 6= mi+1, ni 6= ni+1 and bmini is the (mi, ni)-th entry of B then the
Tanner graph of the parity-check matrix has 2k-cycles. To compute the number of 4-cycles all
of 2 × 2 submatrices have to be investigated. And for 6-cycles all of 3 × 3 submatrices are
considered. But, computing Equation (3) is time-consuming especially when 2k is more than
6. For example, in order to investigate the existence or non-existence of 8-cycles we have to
consider all of submatrices of sizes 2× 2, 2× 3, 2× 4, 3× 2, 3× 3, 3× 4, 4× 2, 4× 3 and
4 × 4. In this paper our goal is to reduce the conditions on which the existence of 2k-cycles
are considered. To reach our goal we define matrices named as difference matrices which are
denoted by D and DD.

III. SINGLE-EDGE PROTOGRAPH BASED QC-LDPC CODES
In this section we investigate Equation (3) for 2k-cycles, especially those of sizes 4, 6, 8 and
10. And for each of these considerations we investigate the conditions of difference matrices D
and/or DD. We also provide lower bounds for the lifting degree, where the Tanner graph is free
of the 8-cycles or 10-cycles. Then we compare the complexity of search algorithm when we
apply Fossorier’s Lemma to the exponent matrix, B, with when we apply the matrices, D and
DD. For each size of cycles we provide a subsection. But before, we explain how to construct
two difference matrices D and DD as follows.
Definition 1: Suppose B is an exponent matrix shown above, the difference matrix, D, is as
follows:
D =

If B includes an (?) as its element then we put ?? bij = ? and ??? = ?.
We also utilize another matrix to reduce the complexity. It is obtained from D, and we denote
it by DD.
Definition 2: Suppose Dij and Dij? are two elements of i-th row of the difference matrix, D,
then (Dij ?Dij?, Dij? ?Dij), of course mod N , is an element of i-th row of DD. So DD is
a matrix of size
(

A. 4-cycles
In order to consider 4-cycles, Equation (3) is investigated for every 2× 2 submatrix. Suppose
a 2× 2 submatrix in two rows i1 and i2 and two columns j1 and j2 is under consideration, then
Equation (3) gives (bi1j1 ? bi1j2) + (bi2j2 ? bi2j1) = 0 ( mod N). But in order to consider
4-cycles making use of the difference matrix, D, we rearrange the latter equality as follows:
(bi1j1 ? bi2j1)? (bi1j2 ? bi2j2) = 0 ( mod N).
Proposition 1: The Tanner graph is 4-cycle free if and only if there are no equal elements in
any row of the difference matrix, D.
Proof : Given 1 ? i1, i2 ? m (i1 < i2). The expression (bi1j1 ? bi2j1) is an element of D located
in i-th row and j1-th column, where i =
(
m
2
)
?
(
m?i1+1
2
)
+ i2 ? i1, and (bi1j2 ? bi2j2) is another
element of D in i-th row and j2-th column. So we conclude that if bi1j1 ? bi2j1 = bi1j2 ? bi2j2 (
mod N) then the Tanner graph has 4-cycles. 
Corollary 1: The Tanner graph is 4-cycle free if and only if there is no zero element in the
difference matrix, DD.
In [2] all non-isomorphich (3, n)-regular single-edge QC-LDPC codes for 4 ? n ? 12 along
with their minimum distances are represented. In order to extend the result we make use of
difference matrices and provide the number of non-isomorphic (or simply NI numbers) (4, n)-
regular single-edge QC-LDPC codes for 5 ? n ? 11 and present one exponent matrix for each of
the existing minimum distance in the following table. The first row and column of the exponent
matrices are all-zero which are omitted.
B. 6-cycles
In this subsection we first consider 6-cycles for three types of exponent matrices with row
weights 3, 4 and 5. Then we present a structure to consider 6-cycles in m×n exponent matrices.

The left side of Equation (3) gives the following 6 equalities. Moreover, for each expression
we obtain the corresponding equality making use of the elements of the difference matrix, D,
• bi0j0 ? bi0j1 + bi1j1 ? bi1j2 + bi2j2 ? bi2j0 = (bi0j0 ? bi2j0)? (bi0j1 ? bi1j1)? (bi1j2 ? bi2j2)
• bi0j1 ? bi0j0 + bi1j0 ? bi1j2 + bi2j2 ? bi2j1 = ?(bi0j0 ? bi1j0) + (bi0j1 ? bi2j1)? (bi1j2 ? bi2j2)

As a result, each expression in the right side of the six equations above includes three elements
of a distributed diagonal of D? with the assumption that the elements in the first and the third
rows are multiplied by ?1. So we proved the following lemma.
Lemma 1: Let D be a difference matrix corresponding to a 3× n exponent matrix, B. Then
the Tanner graph is 6-cycle free if and only if ?D1j1 + D2j2 ? D3j3 6= 0 (mod N) for all
j1 6= j2, j1 6= j3, j2 6= j3 (j1, j2, j3 ? {0, 1, . . . , (n? 1)}).

The submatrix B? contains four 3 × 3 submatrices. Suppose the first three rows are chosen to
consider Equation (3). So the obtained equalities are as the same as 6 equalities mentioned above

Similarly, we consider all of 3×3 submatrices of the difference matrix corresponding to a 5×n
exponent matrix. And the result is as the following lemma.

All of the expressions are computed in modular N .
Generally, if 6-cycles of an m × n exponent matrix are under consideration then by obtaining
the corresponding difference matrix, D, we have to determine the existence of 6-cycles for some
triples of form (i, j, k), where i, j, k ? {0, 1, . . . , (m2 )}. For example, as mentioned in the lemmas
above, triples for exponent matrices with four rows are (1,2,4), (1,3,5), (2,3,6) and (4,5,6). And
triples for exponent matrices with five rows are (1,2,5), (1,3,6), (1,4,7), (2,3,8), (2,4,9), (3,4,10),
(5,6,8), (5,7,9), (6,7,10) and (8,9,10). In order to recognize which rows form the mentioned
triples we provide the following method.
Let D be a difference matrix corresponding to an m× n exponent matrix, B. It is clear that
in a 3 × 3 submatrix, which provides 6-cycles, two elements of each row and column of the
submatrix occur in Equation (3). So there are two elements with a row index i, two elements
with a row index i? and two elements with a row index i??. In other words, if ±(bij ? bi?j) and
±(bij? ? bi??j?) are two differences which occur in Equation (3) which are also elements of i1-th
row and i2-th row of D, respectively, then the third row is the one which includes bij?? ? bi??j??
or ?(bij?? ? bi??j??). If it occurs in i3-th row of D then the corresponding triple is (i1, i2, i3).

In [2] 6-cycle considerations for 3 × n exponent matrices whose first row and column are
all-zero are converted into three types. In the following Lemma we demonstrate that making
use of the difference matrix DD it is sufficient to investigate just one type. Moreover, this type
can be utilized for all m× n exponent matrices whose first row and column are all-zero. In the
following Lemma DDij and N ?DDij are the first and second component of ij-th element of
DD, respectively.
Lemma 4: Let DD be a difference matrix corresponding to a m × n exponent matrix, B.
Suppose the first row of the 3 × 3 submatrix under 6-cycle consideration is all-zero. If Tanner
graph is 6-cycle free then we have:
DDij2 6= DDi?j3, DDij2 6= DDi?j1, DDij1 6= DDi?j2 , DDij1 6= ?DDi?j3, DDij3 6= ?DDi?j1
and DDij3 6= DDi?j2 ,
where i 6= i?, i, i? ? {1, 2, m ? 1}. Disjoint columns j1, j2 and j3 of DD are corresponding
to the three columns of D.
Taking benefit of the above Lemma, 6-cycle considerations for a 4 × n exponent matrix has
two types. First type belongs to equations 1,2 and 3 in Lemma 2 which are investigated by the
difference matrix, DD. And the second one is ?D4j1 + D5j2 ? D6j3 6= 0. In addition, for a
5× n exponent matrix, equations 1 to 6 in Lemma 3 are investigated by the difference matrix,
DD. So just the last four equations in Lemma 3 are considered by the difference matrix, D.
Besides declining the complexity of search algorithm, Lemma 4 has significant contribution
which we will see in finding exponent matrices whose Tanner graph has girth 10. This merit
will be proposed in the next 8-cycle consideration.
C. 8-cycles
Nine types of submatrices have to be investigated in order to obtain a QC-LDPC code avoiding
8-cycles. The mentioned submatrices are of sizes 2×2, 2×3, 2×4, 3×2, 3×3, 3×4, 4×2, 4×3
and 4 × 4. Taking benefits of two matrices D and DD we reduce the complexity of search
space in a great extent. We prove that in order to construct an exponent matrix with girth 10
there is no need to investigate all of the mentioned submatrices. More important, if the first
row and column of the exponent matrix are all-zero then there is no need to consider 6-cycles
on 3 × 3 submatrices whose first row are the all-zero. Because the non-existence of 8-cycles
guarantees the non-existence of 6-cycles too. In this subsection we also provide a lower bound
on the lifting degree of QC-LDPC codes whose Tanner graphs have girth at least 10. We prove
September 5, 2017 DRAFT
12
that the minimum lifting degree of QC-LDPC codes with girth 10 is 2
(
n
2
)(
m

)
+1. Our proposed
lower bound improves the one in [8], which is n(n? 1)(m? 1) + 1.
In the following Lemma we provide our principle tool to consider 8-cycles.
Lemma 5: If an 8-cycle contains more than two elements of a column of the exponent matrix
then it contains two 2× 2 submatrices.
Proof : We prove one of the types of submatrices which satisfies the condition of Lemma, others
are alike and are omitted. Suppose the left side of Equation (3) is achieved by a 4×3 submatrix.
For example, it is bi0j0 ?bi0j1 +bi1j1 ?bi1j2 +bi2j2 ?bi2j1 +bi3j1 ?bi3j0 . The two 2×2 submatrices
are
B? =
?
?
bi0j0 bi0j1
bi3j0 bi3j1
?
? and B?? =
?
?
bi1j1 bi1j2
bi2j1 bi2j2
?
?.
 The advantage of the above lemma is that we can obtain an equivalence for Equation (3)
whose elements belong to two rows of the difference matrix. Whereas, the left side of Equation
(3) can be rearranged in a way that more than two rows of the difference matrix are involved.
For example, bi0j0 ? bi0j1 + bi1j1 ? bi1j2 + bi2j2 ? bi2j1 + bi3j1 ? bi3j0 = bi0j0 ? bi3j0 ? (bi0j1 ? bi1j1)?
(bi1j2 ? bi2j2) ? (bi2j1 ? bi3j1) = Di?j0 ? Dij1 ? Di??j2 ? Di???j1 which contains four rows of the
difference matrix, where i < i? < i?? < i???.
In the following theorem we make clear the advantage of applying the matrix, DD, in our
8-cycle considerations. The proof of the theorem is provided in Appendix A.
Theorem 1: A QC-LDPC code has no 8-cycles if and only if:
• the matrix obtained by multiplying the difference matrix, DD, by 2 (or simply 2DD) has
no zero element and,
• the matrix DD has no repeated elements and,
• each 4× 4 submatrix of the difference matrix, D, satisfies the following inequality
Dij0 ?Di?j1 ?Di??j2 ?Di???j3 6= 0 ( mod N),
where i, i?, i??, i??? ? {0, 1, . . . ,
(
m
2
)
} and j0, j1, j2, j3 ? {0, 1, . . . , n? 1}.
According to theorem above, if we use the matrix DD then there is no need to consider all
of submatrices of sizes 2 × 3, 2 × 4, 3 × 2, 3 × 3, 3 × 4, 4 × 2 and 4 × 3, but instead, we
consider the non-existence of repeated elements in the matrix, DD.
Example 2: Suppose B is the 3 × 4 exponent matrix given in this section. As N = 37 is
an odd number, for ij-th element of 2DD we have 2DDij 6= 0 (mod N). So B holds in
DRAFT September 5, 2017
13
the first condition of the above theorem. As we see, in this case no computation is required.
By comparing each two elements of the matrix, DD, we conclude that there are no repeated
elements in DD. Hence, B holds in the second condition of the above theorem. Moreover, since
the last condition of the above theorem needs 4 rows it is not considered for the given exponent
matrix. As a whole, the Tanner graph is 8-cycle free. Whereas, the number of Equations (3) for
submatrices of sizes 2× 2, 2× 3, 2× 4, 3× 2, 3× 3 and 3× 4 is 168.
In appendix A, we compute the number of equations required to consider 8-cycles when we
use Fossorier’s equation. Note that, the number of computations for each type of submatrices is
nine times as many as the number of equations. As an example, in the table III we provide the
number of equations, when we use Fossorier’s Lemma, for m = 3, 4, 5, 6 as follows.

then the exponent matrix is 8-cycle free. The number of computations in this case

. More imprtantly, in the following we demonstrate the significant reduction in the
search space by making use of our proposed difference matrices.
Corollary 3: Suppose B is a 3 × n exponent matrix. If the first row and column of B are
all-zero then the non-existence of 8-cycles guarantees the non-existence of 6 cycles.
Proof : If Tanner graph is 8-cycle free then according to Theorem 1 the difference matrix, DD,
has no repeated elements. Therefore, all of inequalities in lemma 4 occur and Tanner graph is
free of 6-cycles as well. 
We conclude that if the goal is constructing 3×n exponent matrices with girth 10 whose first
column and row are all-zero then by obtaining a difference matrix, DD, with disjoint non-zero
elements there is no need to consider 6-cycles. And, none of 2× 2 submatrices are investigated
for 4-cycles. Moreover, we generalize the corollary for all m× n exponent matrices whose first
row and column are all-zero as follows.
Corollary 4: Suppose B is an m× n exponent matrix. If the first row and column of B are
all-zero then the non-existence of 8-cycles proves that equations related to 6-cycle considerations
in which the first row of exponent matrix is involved is non-zero.
According to the above corollary if Tanner graph is 8-cycle free then in order to obtain a
Tanner graph with girth 10 there is no need to check 3 × 3 submatrices whose first row is
all-zero.
There are three exponent matrices in the literature for (3, n)-regular QC-LDPC codes, where
n = 4, 5, 6, whose Tanner graphs have girth 10 and the lifting degrees obtained are 37, 61 and
91, respectively. Applying the above corollary, we compare the number of computations required
to consider in two cases. For the first case we use Fossorier’s Lemma by which 1686, 4410,
9555 computations are required. For the second case we use the matrix, DD, by which the
number of computations are 219, 540 and 1142, respectively. As we see, thanks to the matrix,
DD, the number of computaions is much less than those when we apply Fossorier’s Lemma.
Moreover, the number of non-isomorphic QC-LDPC codes obtained by our proposed technique
is more than the presented QC-LDPC codes in [2]. We accumulate them in the following table.
Furthermore, making use of difference matrices we obtain a (3,7) and (3,8) exponent matrices
with girth 10 and lifting degrees N = 145 and 211. The minimum N achieved in the literature
are 159 and 219, respectively.
In addition to reducing the search space, making use of the matrix, DD, provides us with a
chance to obtain a lower bound on the lifting degree of QC-LDPC codes with girth 10 which

bound is tight.
Theorem 2: The lifting degree of QC-LDPC codes with girth 10 is at least 2
(
n

)(
m
2
)
+ 1.
Proof : Since the Tanner graphs of (m,n)-regular QC-LDPC codes are 8-cycle free, from the
second condition of Theorem 1, the difference matrix, DD, has no repeated elements. So the
matrix DD contains
(
m
2
)
n(n? 1) disjoint elements. As a result, we have N ? 2

The minimum lifting degrees (3,n)-regular QC-LDPC codes, n = 4, 5, 6, which in the literature
are obtained search-based acknowledge our proposed lower bound. They are N = 37, 61 and
91, respectivle. So our proposed lower bound is tight.
Moreover, the non-existence of repeated elements in the difference matrix, DD, to have an
8-cycles free Tanner graph contribute to determine whether a structure can give QC-LDPC code
with girth 10 or not. In the following example we demonstrate Tanner graph of QC-LDPC code
based on the symmetrical construction presented in [10] has 8-cycles.
Example 3: In [10] it is shown that if n is an even number then by recognizing the left half
of an exponent matrix with girth at least 8, denoted by A, it is possible to reach the exponent
matrix by assuming B = [A ? A]. Since the first row of B is all-zero. If bij and ?bij are two
elements of B then (?bij , bij) and (bij ,?bij) are two elements occuring in DD. Therefore DD
has repeated elements and consequently Tanner graph has 8-cycles.

D. 10-cycles
Nine types of submatrices have to be investigated in order to obtain a QC-LDPC code avoiding
10-cycles. At least three rows and three columns are required to obtain the left side of Equation
(3). So the mentioned submatrices are of sizes 3× 3, 3× 4, 3× 5, 4× 3, 4× 4, 4× 5, 5× 3, 5× 4
and 5 × 5. In this case the matrices, D and DD, of the exponent matrix, B, are also required.
In the following we provide our principle tool to consider 10-cycles.
Lemma 6: If the left side of Equation (3), when 10-cycles are under consideration, contains
more than two elements of a column of the exponent matrix then its equivalent expression whose
elements belong to the difference matrix includes three elements occur in three rows and three
columns of D.
Proof : We prove one of types of submatrices which satisfies the condition of Lemma, others are
alike and are omitted. Suppose the left side of Equation (3) is achieved by a 3 × 5 submatrix.
For example it is bi0j0 ? bi0j1 + bi1j1 ? bi1j2 + bi2j2 ? bi2j3 + bi1j3 ? bi1j4 + bi2j4 ? bi2j0 . By
rearranging this expression we conclude that 6 terms of the obtained expression are related to
3 elements of the matrix, D, which occur in three rows and three columns of D. They are
(bi0j0 ? bi2j0) ? (bi0j1 ? bi1j1) ? (bi1j2 ? bi2j2) = Dij0 ? Di?j1 ? Di??j2 . And the other terms are
bi1j3 ? bi2j3 and ?(bi1j4 ? bi2j4) whose equivalent elements of the matrix D, Di??j3 and Di??j4 ,
appear in a 2× 2 submatrix of the matrix, D.  The advantage of the above Lemma is that we
can obtain an equivalence for Equation (3) whose elements belong to the difference matrix, D.
And more importantly, the elements which are not in the same row or column are investigated
in 6-cycle considerations once. So, we can utilise our computations in 6-cycle considerations for
investigating 10-cycles.
In the following theorem we provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for a QC-LDPC
code whose Tanner graph is free of 10-cycles. The proof is presented in Appendix B.
Theorem 3: A QC-LDPC code has no 10-cycles if and only if:
• by choosing every three rows of the exponent matrix, the set consisting of expressions
obtained from the 6-cycle considerations has no intersection by the elements of their three
equivalent rows of the matrix, DD, and,
• by choosing every three rows i, i?, i?? and three columns j, j?, j?? of the difference matrix,
D, the set, X , consists of expressions ?Dij +Di?j? ?Di??j?? has no common element with
a set consisting of the elements of the matrix DD, which occur in the rows different from
DRAFT September 5, 2017
17
three rows i, i?, i??. In addition, there is no intersection between the set X and the values
obtained by adding or subtracting every two elements on the distributed diagonals of 2× 2
submatrices of D. Since there are 5 elements for every expression in 10-cycle considerations,
the mentioned elements on the distributed diagonal are different from those in the 3 × 3
submatrix of D and,
• each 5× 5 submatrix of the difference matrix, D, satisfies the following inequality
Dij0 ?Di?j1 ?Di??j2 ?Di???j3 ?Di????j4 6= 0,
where i 6= i? 6= i?? 6= i??? 6= i???? ? {0, 1, . . . ,

The set A consisting of the obtained values from 6-cycle considerations is as follows:
A = {4 5 11 15 21 22 25 28 30 32 34 37 40 47 53 54 59 67}.
And the elements occurring in the matrix, DD, is
B = {1 2 3 7 8 9 10 12 13 16 17 18 23 24 27 29 31 35 38 42 44 46 49 50 55 56 57 60 61
63 64 65 66 70 71 72}.
Since A ? B = ? the first condition of theorem above holds for the given exponent matrix.
So instead of computing all of equations related to 10-cycle considerations for 3× 3 and 3× 4
submatrices, which are 648 equations we consider the non-existence of repeated values in two
sets above. It is clear that this manner reduces the complexity of the search algorithm in a great
extent. For this exponent matrix just 3× 3 and 3× 4 submatrices have to be investigated. As a
result, the Tanner graph corresponding to the exponent matrix, B, is 10-cycle free.
In Appendix B we compute the number of equations required to consider 10-cycles when we
use Fossorier’s equation and in the following table we summarize them. Note that the number of
September 5, 2017 DRAFT

computations for each type of submatrices is eleven times as many as the number of equations.
As we see, the first three submatrices are according to the first condition of theorem above, the
second three submatrices are according to the second condition of the theorem and there is no
need to consider the submatrices of sizes 5 × 3 and 5 × 4 when the matrices D and DD are

Theorem 4: If A is a set including all values obtained by 6-cycle considerations and B contains
all of values of the matrix, DD then for a regular QC-LDPC code whose Tanner graph is 10-cycle
free we have A ? B = ?.
Proof : As shown in the theorem above if i, i?, i?? are three rows corresponding to three rows in
6-cycle considerations, all of values obtained from 6-cycle considerations have no intersection
with elements of three rows i, i?, i?? of the matrix, DD. Moreover, the second condition of the
theorem shows these values have also no intersection with other rows of the matrix, DD. As a
result, there are no common elements between two sets. 
Corollary 5: The minimum lifting degree of a regular QC-LDPC code whose Tanner graph
is 10-cycle free is more that |A|+
(
m
2
)
n(n? 1) + 1, where A is a set of all values from the left
side of equations of Fossorier’s Lemma in 6-cycle considerations.
For example, in the example above |A| = 18 and
(
m
2
)
n(n ? 1) + 1 = 37 so N ? 55. From the
corollary we conclude that to obtain a regular QC-LDPC code whose Tanner graph is 10-cycle
free the minimum lifting degree can be guessed after considering 6-cycles.

IV. MULTIPLE-EDGE PROTOGRAPH-BASED QC-LDPC CODES
In [1], [4] and [9] it is proved that Bptg including i-component, where i ? 3 results in the
parity-check matrix whose Tanner Graph has 6-cycles. Also the existence of submatrices like
[2 2] and
?

? of Bptg guarantees the existence of 8-cycles and 10-cycles, respectively.
These cycles are known as inevitable cycles, which we define them in the following. All of the
submatrices for inevitable cycles of sizes up to 20 have been investigated in the literature.
Definition 3: An inevitable cycle of length 2k? in the Tanner graph of a QC-LDPC code with
the lifting degree N is a cycle that always appears in the Tanner graph of the code regardless of
how high the lifting degree N is. That is the equation (4) are always equal to zero, regardless
of the value of N .
Example 5: Let m = 3, n = 4 and N = 13. Consider the following exponent matrix for a
(3, 4)-regular multiple-edge QC-LDPC code:
B =

in Tanner graph of the code, respectively.

In the following subsection (4-cycles) we will demonstrate that the number of equalities
required to be computed in multiple-edge QC-LDPC codes are much more than the ones in
single-edge QC-LDPC codes. Thanks to difference matrices we will define in the following we
obtain the analitical lower bound on the lifting degree of multiple-edge QC-LDPC codes with
girth 6. We also construct some exponent matrices to show that the obtained lower bound is
tight. Note that, the difference matrices can be used to all 2k-considerations.
Definition 4: Let B be an exponent matrix. For each element of B like ~Bij we take a vector of
size 2
(

)
as an element of the difference matrix D whose elements are obtained by subtracting
every two elemnt of ~Bij . If ij-th element of B is (?) then its equivalent element in D is (?)

of B then a vector ( ~Bij , ~Bi?j) whose elements are obtained by subtracting one entry of ~Bij and
one entry of ~Bi?j is taken as an element of the difference matrix DD. It is clear that the vector
( ~Bij , ~Bi?j) is of size | ~Bij| × | ~Bi?j|. So there is a row for each two rows of B. It means that for
the exponent matrix of size m× n the matrix DD is of size

A. 4-Cycles
There are four states to consider all 4-cycles in a multiple-edge QC-LDPC code. They are as
follows.
I. Let Bzij , B
l
ij ? ~Bij . All submatrices such as [B
z
ij , B
l
ij] have two 1-components in each row
and column, when substituting by their corresponding CPMs. So in order to enumerate 4-
cycles we can take into consideration such a submatrix as a 2×2 submatrix like
?
?
Bzij B
l
ij
Blij B
z
ij
?
?.
As a result, if 2(Bzij ?B
l
ij) = 0 ( mod N) then there are 4-cycles.
II. Let Bzij , B
l
ij ? ~Bij and B
z?
ik, B
l?
ik ?
~Bik. If we have [(B
z
ij B
l
ij) (B
z?
ik B
l?
ik)] as a submatrix,
then the equality ±(Bzij ?B
l
ij)± (B
z?
ik ? B
l?
ik) = 0 ( mod N) results in 4-cycles.
III. Let Bzij , B
l
ij ? ~Bij and B
z?
kj, B
l?
kj ?
~Bkj . We have to apply Equation (4) for all submatrices
such as
?

l
ij) ± (B

graph has 4-cycles.

IV. We have to apply Equation (4) for all submatrices such as
?
?
~Bij ~Bik
~Bi?j ~Bi?k
?
?. This submatrix
includes (| ~Bij| × | ~Bik| × | ~Bi?j| × | ~Bi?k|), 2× 2 submatrices for which we have to consider
4-cycles.
In the gollowing, taking benefits of two difference matrices D and DD we investigate the
necessary and sufficient conditions for a multiple-edge QC-LDPC code to have girth at least 6.
Theorem 5: A multiple-edge QC-LDPC code is free of 4-cycles if and only if
• 2×D ( mod N) contains no zero element,
• There are no repeated elements in each row and each column of D,
• Each row of DD is free of repeated elements.
Proof : In the state I in 4-cycle considerations we have 2(Bzij?B
l
ij) = 0. Since B
z
ij, B
l
ij ? ~Bij we
conclude that Bzij?B
l
ij is an entry of the ij-the vector of the difference matrix, D, corresponding
to ~Bij . So in order to construct multiple-edge QC-LDPC codes with girth at least 6 it is necessary
to have a difference matrix, D, for which the matrix 2D is free of zero elements.
From the state II we conclude that if girth is at least 6 then each row of the difference matrix,
D, is free of repeated elements. Because, ±(Bzij ? B
l
ij) and ±(B
z
ik ? B
l
ik) occur in the vectors
of D which are corresponding to the vectors ~Bij and ~Bik of B, respectively. similarly, from the
state III we conclude that if girth is at least 6 then each column of the difference matrix, D, is
free of repeated elements.
As mentioned in the state IV, for a submatrix of B such as
?
?
~Bij ~Bik
~Bi?j ~Bi?k
?
? there are
(| ~Bij| + | ~Bik| + | ~Bi?j | + | ~Bi?k|), 2 × 2 submatrices to investigate. Suppose B
l
ij ? ~Bij , B
l?
ik ?
~Bik, B
z
i?j ?
~Bi?j and B
z?
i?k ?
~Bi?k are elements of a 2×2 submatrix. Then the equality B
l
ij?B
l?
ik+
Bz
?
i?k ? B
z
i?j = 0 ( mod N) or equivalently the equality B
l
ij ? B
z
i?j = B
l?
ik ? B
z?
i?k ( mod N)
gives 4-cycles. Since Blij ? B
z
i?j and B
l?
ik ? B
z?
i?k occur in a row of the difference matrix, DD,
we conclude that repeated elements in a row of DD gives rise to 4-cycles. 
One of the most important advantages of taking two difference matrices D and DD is the
lower bound of the lifting degree which is analyticaly obtained.
Theorem 6: Let B be the exponent matrix of a multiple-edge QC-LDPC code of size m× n
with girth at least 6. We take three variables as follows.
A = max{2
?n
j=1
(
| ~Bij |
2
)
; i = 1, 2 . . . , m}, B = max{2
?m
i=1

)
; j = 1, 2 . . . , n} and
C = max{
?n
j=1 |
~Bij| × | ~Bi?j|; i 6= i
?; i, i? ? {1, 2 . . . , m}}.
September 5, 2017 DRAFT

The minimum lifting degree is at least N = max{A,B,C}.
Proof : According to the previous theorem, since girth is at least 6 every row of the difference
matrix, D, has no repeated elements. So A is the maximum number of elements occuring in
a row of D. Similarly, B is the maximum number of elements appearing in a column of D.
In addition, girth is at least 6 so in the difference matrix, DD, every row is without repaeted
elemnts. Therefore, the maximum number of elements in a row of DD is C. As a result, the
minimum lifting degree is at least the maximum of A, B and C. 
Example 8: Let B be the exponent matrix of a multiple-edge (4, 2n)-regular QC-LDPC code
with girth at least 6 whose elements in the corresponding base matrix is 2. Then every element
in the difference matrix, D is a vector of size 2. Therefore, there are 2n elements in each row
of the difference matrix D. As a result A = 2n. Also the number of elemnts in each column
of D is 4, so |B| = 4. The difference matrix, DD, is a row with n vectors of size 4, hence,
|C| = 4n. Consequently, N ? 4n.
In this paper, we present exponent matrices of multiple-edge (4, 2n)-regular QC-LDPC codes
with girth 6 and N = 4n, where 2 ? n ? 6. These matrices demonstrate that the obtained
lower bound of the lifting degree in Theorem 6 is tight. In the following table we compare
the minimum lifting degrees and also the lengths of both single-edge and multiple-edge QC-
LDPC codes with the same row and column weight. It shows that the length of multiple-edge
(4, 2n)-regular QC-LDPC codes with girth 6 is much less than their counterparts.

• If dij ? ~Dij, dij? ? ~Dij? and dij?? ? ~Dij?? are elements of the difference matrix, D, then
±dij ± dij? ± dij?? 6= 0 ( mod N).
• Suppose two rows i and i? and two columns j and j? of the exponent matrix are under
consideration. If their corresponding vectors in the difference matrix, DD, are ~DD(ii?)j ,
~DD(ii?)j? then construct a set A, with cardinality | ~DD(ii?)j || ~DD(ii?)j?|, whose elements are

V. CONCLUSION
Many efforts have been put into constructing quasi-cyclic low density parity-check (QC-LDPC)
codes with large girths, shortest lengths for a specific degree distribution. The property of the
shortest length has been investigated for QC-LDPC codes lifted from fully-connected base graphs
known as single-edge protographs. Moreover, there are some lower bounds on the lifting degree
of QC-LDPC codes with different girths. In this paper, we take an m × n exponent matrix,
B, then define two matrices named as “difference matrices”, denoted by D and DD which
contribute to reduce the complexity of search algorithms to achieve a regular QC-LDPC code

with the shortest length and the certain girth. More importantly, making use of these matrices
we demonstrate that the necessary and sufficient condition for the difference matrix D of a QC-
LDPC code to have a Tanner graph with girth 6 is that every row is free of repeated elements.
In addition, we prove that if the elements of the first row and the first column of the exponent
matrix are zeros and Tanner graph is free of 8-cycles then in order to achieve a Tanner graph
with girth 10 there is no need to check 6-cycle equalities on 3×3 submatrices containing the first
row. Furthermore, making use of these matrices we provide some lower bounds on the lifting
degree, denoted by N , of a regular QC-LDPC code with specific column and row weights and
the desired girth. In fact, we prove that if an exponent matrix is of size m×n then for QC-LDPC
codes whose Tanner graphs have the girth of 10 and 12 we have N ?
(
m
2
)
n(n ? 1) + 1 and
N ? |A| +
(
m
2
)
n(n ? 1) + 1, where A is a set of all values from the left side of equations of
Fossorier’s Lemma in 6-cycle considerations, respectively. The lower bound when girth is 10 is
improved in comparison with the one in the literature. Applying difference matrices we obtain
the exact number of non-isomorphic (3, n) QC-LDPC codes with girth 10 for n = 5, 6. Also for
n = 7, 8 we obtain a lifting degree N = 145 and 211, respectively, which are less than those
provided in the literature, N = 159 and 219, respectively.
We also attempt to achieve some usefull results related to both regular and irregular multiple-
edge QC-LDPC codes with girth 6 and 8. We demonstrate a tight lower bound on the lifting
degree when girth is 6 along with some exponent matrices to show the tightness of our proposed
bound. In fact, we analytically prove that if ~Bij is ij-th element of the exponent matrix B then
by taking three values A = max{2
?n
j=1
(
| ~Bij |

)
; i = 1, 2 . . . , m}, B = max{2

1, 2 . . . , n} and C = max{
?n
j=1 |
~Bij| × | ~Bi?j|; i 6= i
?; i, i? ? {1, 2 . . . , m}} the minimum lifting
degree is at least N = max{A,B,C}. Another consequence is regarding to reduction in the
equalities required to be investigated when Tanner graph with girth 8 is desired. For this case
we present some exponent matrices too.

In this appendix we simultaneously prove the theorem 4 and compute the number of equations
for each submatrix when 8-cycles are under consideration. In order to prove we divide 8-cycle
investigations into three cases. In the first case all submatrices contain two rows of the exponent
matrix. In the second case they include three rows and for the third case there are four rows
for each submatrix. Moreover, for each case there are three items to consider. Proof : Case 1:
Submatrices which include two rows of the exponent matrix. Suppose they are i0 and i1.
1) If two columns are j0, j1 then the left side of Equation (1) is
bi0j0 ? bi0j1 + bi1j1 ? bi1j0 + bi0j0 ? bi0j1 + bi1j1 ? bi1j0 = 2(bi0j0 ? bi0j1 + bi1j1 ? bi1j0).
By rearranging the equation we obtain the following relation.
2((bi0j0 ? bi1j0)? (bi0j1 ? i1j1)) = 2(Dij0 ?Dij1),
where i ? {0, 1, . . . ,
(
m
2
)
}. So, in the difference matrix of 8-cycle free QC-LDPC codes
we have 2(Dij0 ? Dij1) 6= 0. Since (Dij0 ? Dij1) is a component of an element of the
matrix, DD, in 8-cycle free QC-LDPC codes the matrix, 2DD, has no zero element. So
the first condition of the theorem is proved by this item.
In this item if Fossorier’s equation is used then
(
m
2
)(
n
2
)
equations are required to investigate.
And for each one there are 9 operations to compute. So the number of computations is
9
(
m
2
)(
n
2
)
. Whereas, by the matrix 2DD the number of operations is
(
m
2
)(
n
2
)
.
2) Take j0, j1, j2 as three columns of submatrices. The left side of Equation (1) and its
corresponding equation whose elements belong to D are as follows:
DRAFT September 5, 2017
27
bi0j0 ? bi0j1 + bi1j1 ? bi1j2 + bi0j2 ? bi0j1 + bi1j1 ? bi1j0 = (bi0j0 ? bi1j0) ? (bi0j1 ? bi1j1) +
(bi0j2 ? bi1j2)? (bi0j1 ? bi1j1) = Dij0 ?Dij1 +Dij2 ?Dij1 .
So, in the difference matrix of an 8-cycle free QC-LDPC code we have Dij0 ? Dij1 +
Dij2 ?Dij1 6= 0. Or equivalently, Dij0 ?Dij1 6= Dij1 ?Dij2 . To obtain this inequality the
8-cycle is started from bi0j0 . If the cycle is started from bi0j1 then we obtain one of the
inequalities Dij0 ?Dij1 6= ?(Dij0 ?Dij2) or Dij0 ?Dij2 6= ?(Dij1 ?Dij2). Note that the
two sides of inequalities are components of two elements of i-th row of the matrix DD.
Therefore, in this item if Fossorier’s equation is used then 3
(
m
2
)(
n
3
)
equations are required
to investigate. And 27
(
m
2
)(
n
3
)
operations are computed.
3) Consider four columns j0, j1, j2 and j3. Like the previous item by investigating Equations
(1) and their equivalences in the difference matrix of 8-cycle free QC-LDPC codes we have:
±(Dij0 ?Dij1) 6= ±(Dij2 ?Dij3). Note that the two sides of inequalities are components
of two elements of i-th row of the matrix DD.
In this item if Fossorier’s equation is used then 6
(
m
2
)(
n
4
)
equations are required to inves-
tigate. The number of computations is 54
(
m
2
)(
n
4
)
.
The items 2 and 3 result in the existence of 2
(
m
2
)
disjoint elements for each row of DD.
Suppose (Dij ? Dij?, Dij? ? Dij) and (Dij ? Dij??, Dij?? ? Dij) are two elements of i-th
row of DD. If they have elements in common then one of the following equalities occurs
which contradicts the assumption that the Tanner graph is 8-cycle free. The equalities
are Dij? = Dij?? or (Dij ? Dij?) + Dij ? Dij?? = 0. The item 3 proves that the equality
±(Dij ?Dij?) = ±(Dij?? ?Dij???) provides 8-cycles.
Case 2: Submatrices which include three rows of the exponent matrix. Suppose they are
i0, i1 and i2.
4) Suppose two columns are j0, j1. The left side of Equations (1) and their corresponding
equations whose elements belong to D are as follows:
1) bi0j0 ? bi0j1 + bi1j1 ? bi1j0 + bi2j0 ? bi2j1 + bi1j1 ? bi1j0 = (bi0j0 ? bi1j0)? (bi0j1 ? bi1j1)?
(bi1j0 ? bi2j0) + (bi1j1 ? bi2j1) = Dij0 ?Dij1 ?Di?j0 +Di?j1 ,
2) bi1j0 ? bi1j1 + bi0j1 ? bi0j0 + bi2j0 ? bi2j1 + bi0j1 ? bi0j0 = ?(bi0j0 ? bi1j0)+ (bi0j1 ? bi1j1)?
(bi0j0 ? bi2j0) + (bi0j1 ? bi2j1) = ?Dij0 +Dij1 ?Di?j0 +Di?j1 ,
3) bi1j0 ? bi1j1 + bi2j1 ? bi2j0 + bi0j0 ? bi0j1 + bi2j1 ? bi2j0 = (bi0j0 ? bi2j0)? (bi0j1 ? bi2j1) +
(bi1j0 ? bi2j0)? (bi1j1 ? bi2j1) = Dij0 ?Dij1 +Di?j0 ?Di?j1 .
So, by considering all of conditions above, for 8-cycle free QC-LDPC codes we have:
September 5, 2017 DRAFT
28
±(Dij0 ? Dij1) 6= ±(Di?j0 ? Di?j1), where i 6= i
?; i, i? ? {0, 1, . . . ,
(
m
2
)
}. Thus, in any
column of the matrix DD there are no repeated elements.
In this item if Fossorier’s equation is used then 3(m3 )(
n
2 ) equations are required to investi-
gate. And the number of computations is 27(m3 )(
n
2 ).
5) Take 3×3 submatrices of the exponent matrix, where j0, j1 and j2 are their three columns.
Like the previous item by investigating Equations (1), which contains 9 cases, and their
equivalences in the difference matrix we have: ±(Dij0 ?Dij1) 6= ±(Di?j1 ?Di?j2).
In this item if Fossorier’s equation is used then 18(m3 )(
n
3 ) equations are required to inves-
tigate.
6) Take 3 × 4 submatrices of the exponent matrix, where j0, j1, j2 and j3 are the four
columns. The left side of Equation (1) is
bi0j0 ? bi0j1 + bi1j1 ? bi1j2 + bi2j2 ? bi2j3 + bi1j3 ? bi1j0.
In the following we rearrange the expression to obtain the one whose terms are elements
of D.
(bi0j0?bi1j0)?(bi0j1?bi1j1)?(bi1j2?bi2j2)+(bi1j3?bi2j3) = (Dij0?Dij1)?(Di?j2?Di?j3).
In this case elements in the first term occur in i-th row of D and elements in the second
term occur in i?-th row of D. As a result, if the Tanner graph is 8-cycle free then by taking
each four columns in two rows of D we have ±(Dij0 ?Dij1) 6= ±(Di?j2 ?Di?j3).
In this item if Fossorier’s equation is used then 6
(
m
3
)(
n
4
)
equations are required to inves-
tigate. The number of computations is 54
(
m
3
)(
n
4
)
Case 3: Submatrices which include four rows of the exponent matrix. Suppose they are
i0, i1, i2 and i3.
7) Suppose two columns are j0, j1. The left side of Equations (1) and their corresponding
equations whose elements belong to D are similar to:
bi0j0 ? bi0j1 + bi1j1 ? bi1j0 + bi2j0 ? bi2j1 + bi3j1 ? bi3j0 = Dij0 ?Dij1 +Di?j0 ?Di?j1 .
This case is similar to considering 3 × 2 submatrices. By considering all of them we
obtain the same result. So, for 8-cycle free QC-LDPC codes we have: ±(Dij0 ?Dij1) 6=
±(Di?j0 ?Di?j1), where i 6= i
?; i, i? ? {0, 1, . . . , (m2 )}.
In this item if Fossorier’s equation is used then 6
(
m
4
)(
n
2
)
equations are required to inves-
tigate. Whereas, since this item is considered in 3 × 2 submatrices, there is no need to
investigate again.
DRAFT September 5, 2017

8) Take 4×3 submatrices of the exponent matrix, where j0, j1 and j2 are their three columns.
By investigating all equations we conclude that for 8-cycle free QC-LDPC codes the
following inequality holds: ±(Dij0 ?Dij1) 6= ±(Di?j1 ?Di?j2). So, this case is similar to
considering 3×3 submatrices and is not investigated if the matrix, D is under consideration.
However, if Fossorier’s equation is used then 12(m4 )(
n
3 ) equations are required to investigate.
The items 4 to 8 result in the non-existence of repeated elements for each two rows of
DD. As a whole, the difference matrix, DD, belonging to 8-cycle free QC-LDPC codes
has no repeated entries. Consequently, from the items 2 to 8 the second condition of the
theorem is proved.
9) If four columns are j0, j1, j2, j3 then Equation (1) is bi0j0 ? bi0j1 + bi1j1 ? bi1j2 + bi2j2 ?
bi2j3 + bi3j3 ? bi3j0 . In the following we rearrange the expression to obtain the one whose
terms are compared with elements of D.
(bi0j0 ? bi3j0)? (bi0j1 ? bi1j1)? (bi1j2 ? bi2j2)? (bi2j3 ? bi3j3) = Dij0 ?Di?j1 ?Di??j2 ?Di???j3.
So in this case all elements of a 4 × 4 submatrix of D are considered. If for every four
elements of the 4 × 4 submatrix, none of which occurs in the same row and the same
column, the above expression is non-zero modular N then such submatrices do not provide
8-cycles. The number of Fossorier’s equation to consider is 8
(
m
4
)(
n

)
. From this item we
conclude the third condition of the theorem.

APPENDIX B
In this appendix we simultaneously prove the theorem 5 and compute the number of equations
for each submatrix when 10-cycles are under consideration. In order to prove we divide 10-cycle
investigations into three cases. In the first case all submatrices contain three rows of the exponent
matrix. In the second case they include four rows and for the third case there are five rows for
each submatrix. Moreover, for each case there are three items to consider. Proof : Case 1:
Submatrices which include three rows of the exponent matrix. Suppose they are i0, i1 and i2. In
this case three elements of the difference matrix, which occur in three columns and three rows,
appear in expressions related to 6-cycle considerations.
1) If three columns are j0, j1, j2 then its equivalent 3 × 3 submatrix, D
?, of the difference
matrix, D, consists of three rows i, i?, i?? and three columns j0, j1, j2. Elements of the
exponent matrix which are investigated for 6-cycles are on a distributed diagonal of D?.
For each three elements on a distributed diagonal of D? there are nine 2×2 submatrices of
September 5, 2017 DRAFT
30
B which are two elements in one row of D?. According to the definition of the difference
matrix, DD, these two elements are one element of DD. So, instead of considering all
nine equations of Fossorier’s Lemma for each distributed diagonal, which are 54 equations
as a whole, we take benefit our results in 6-cycle consideration and the matrix, DD. In
the following we provide the left side of Equation (1) for one of those 54 cases and its
equivalent equation from the matrices, D and DD.
bi1j0?bi1j2+bi2j2?bi2j1+bi0j1?bi0j2+bi1j2?bi1j1+bi0j1?bi0j0 = ?(bi0j0?bi1j0)+(bi0j1?
bi2j1)?(bi1j2?bi2j2)+(bi0j1?bi1j1)?(bi0j2+bi1j2) = ?Dij0+Di?j1?Di??j2+Dij1?Dij2 =
?Dij0 +Di?j1 ? Di??j2 +DDij . Where, j is a column of the matrix, DD. In this item if
Fossorier’s equation is used then 54
(
n
3
)(
m

)
equations are required to investigate.
2) Take j0, j1, j2, j3 as four columns of a 3×4 submatrix. For this item there are 6(
4
3)9 = 216
cases to consider. Because, there are (43) choices for obtaining 3 × 3 submatrices and for
each of them there are 6 considerations related to 6-cycles. The number of mentioned 2×2
submatrices are (32)× (
3
1). The left side of Equation (1) related to one of them is presented
in the following. The right side of the equation consists of the elements of the matrix D.
bi1j0?bi1j2+bi0j2?bi0j3+bi1j3?bi1j2+bi2j2?bi2j1+bi0j1?bi0j0 = ?(bi0j0?bi1j0)+(bi0j1?
bi2j1)? (bi1j2 ? bi2j2)+ (bi0j2 ? bi1j2)? (bi0j3 ? bi1j3) = ?Dij0 +Di?j1 ?Di??j2 +Dij2 ?Dij3 .
As a whole, if ?Dij0+Di?j1?Di??j2+DDij = 0 then the Tanner graph has 10-cycles. In this
item if Fossorier’s equation is used then 432(m3 )(
n
4 ) equations are required to investigate.
3) Take j0, j1, j2, j3, j4 as five columns of a 3×5 submatrix. For this item there are 3×6(
5
3) =
180 cases to consider. Because, there are (53) choices for obtaining 3× 3 submatrices. For
each of them there are 6 considerations related to 6-cycles. The 2×2 submatrices occur in
the other two columns, so, the number of them are (22)× (
3
2) = 3. The left side of Equation
(1) related to one of them is presented in the following.
bi1j0?bi1j2+bi0j2?bi0j3+bi1j3?bi1j4+bi2j4?bi2j1+bi0j1?bi0j0 = ?(bi0j0?bi1j0)+(bi0j1?
bi2j1)? (bi1j4 ? bi2j4)+ (bi0j2 ? bi1j2)? (bi0j3 ? bi1j3) = ?Dij0 +Di?j1 ?Dij4 +Di??j2 +Dij3 .
As a whole, if ?Dij0+Di?j1?Di??j4+DDij = 0 then the Tanner graph has 10-cycle. In this
item if Fossorier’s equation is used then 180(m3 )(
n
5 ) equations are required to investigate.
To prove the first condition of the theorem we utilise three items of case 1. If 3× 3, 3× 4
and 3×5 submatrices for 10-cycles are under consideration then we define two sets A and
B for each 3× 3 submatrix as follows. The set A includes the values obtained by the left
side of equations in 6-cycle considerations. The set B includes all elements of three rows
DRAFT September 5, 2017
31
of the matrix, DD equivalent to three rows of the exponent matrix under consideration. If
A?B 6= ? then the Tanner graph has 10-cycles. Making use of such a manner significantly
decreases the search space and all of values obtained in 6-cycle considerations are utilized
which reduces the considerations in a great extent.
Case 2: Submatrices which include four rows of the exponent matrix. Suppose they are
i0, i1, i2 and i3.
4) Suppose three columns are j0, j1, j2. The 4 × 3 submatrices of the exponent matrix are
equivalent to 4× 3 submatrices, D?, of the difference matrix, D. Like the previous cases,
three elements of D? which are on a distributed diagonal of a 3 × 3 submatrix of D? are
used to replace 6 terms of the left side of inequalities. There are (43) choices for 3 × 3
submatrices of D?. The other row of D? contains two elements which occur in the left side
of Equation (1), when is rearranged by the elements of D. In the rearranged expression
there is the sign ”-” between two elements of D?. They occur in a row different from the
three chosen rows for the 3× 3 submatrix of D?, for which there are (32) choices. So, they
construct an element of the matrix DD. For this item there are 6× 4× 3 = 72 equations
to consider 10-cycles. And in the m×n exponent matrix there are 72×
(
m
4
)(
n
3
)
equations
to investigate 10-cycles.
The left side of one of Equations (1) and its corresponding equation whose elements belong
to D is as follows:
bi0j0 ? bi0j1 + bi1j1 ? bi1j2 + bi2j2 ? bi2j1 + bi3j1 ? bi3j2 + bi2j2 ? bi2j0 = (bi0j0 ? bi2j0)? (bi0j1 ?
bi1j1)? (bi1j2 ? bi2j2)? (bi2j1 ? bi3j1)+(bi2j2 ? bi3j2) = Di?j0 ?Dij1 ?Di??j2 ?Di???j1 +Di???j2 .
As we see, the last two terms of the equation above, in the right side, is equivalent to
one element of the matrix, DD. If it appears in j-th column of DD then the equation
?Dij1 +Di?j0 ?Di??j2 ?DDi???j = 0 provides 10-cycles.
5) Take a 4 × 4 submatrix of the exponent matrix, where j0, j1, j2 and j3 are their four
columns. Like the previous item it is equivalent to a 4 × 4 submatrix of the difference
matrix, D, we denote it by D?. We first choose a 3×3 submatrix of D?. In D?, there are a
row and a column different from those in the chosen 3× 3 submatrix which in their cross
point contain an element appearing in equation based on the elements of D?. One of the
other rows contains another element which occurs in the equation. For this element there
are 9 possibilities to choose. So for each 4 × 4 submatrix of the difference matrix, D,
there are 9×6(43)(
4
3) = 864 equations to consider. And as a whole, the number of 10-cycle
September 5, 2017 DRAFT
32
considerations for this item is 864 ×
(
m
4
)(
n
4
)
. The left side of two of Equations (1) and
their corresponding equations whose elements belong to D are as follows:
1) bi0j0?bi0j1+bi1j1?bi1j2+bi2j2?bi2j3+bi3j3?bi3j2+bi1j2?bi1j0 = ?(bi0j1?bi1j1)+(bi1j2?
bi3j2)? (bi2j3 ?bi3j3)+(bi0j0 ?bi1j0)? (bi1j2 ?bi2j2) = ?Dij1 +Di??j2 ?Di???j3 +Dij0?Di?j2 ,
2) bi0j0?bi0j1+bi1j1?bi1j3+bi3j3?bi3j2+bi1j2?bi1j3+bi2j3?bi2j0 = ?(bi0j1?bi1j1)+(bi0j0?
bi2j0)?(bi1j3?bi3j3)?(bi1j3?bi2j3)+(bi1j2?bi3j2) = ?Di?j1+Dij0?Di??j3?Di???j3+Di???j2 .
As we see, in the first case the last two terms do not occur in the same row but for the
second case they do. Therefore, in the second case we replace these two terms by one
element of the matrix, DD.
6) Take a 4× 5 submatrix of the exponent matrix, where j0, j1, j2, j3 and j4 are their four
columns. Like the previous item it is equivalent to a 4 × 5 submatrix of the difference
matrix, D, we denote it by D?. We first choose a 3 × 3 submatrix of D?. In D?, there
are a row and two columns different from those in the chosen 3 × 3 submatrix which in
their cross point contain two elements appearing in equation based on the elements of D?.
For these elements there are 4 possibilities to choose. So for each 4× 5 submatrix of the
difference matrix, D, there are 4×6(43)(
5
3) = 960 equations to consider. And as whole, the
number of 10-cycle considerations for this item is 960×
(
m
4
)(
n
4
)
.
The left side of one of Equations (1) and its corresponding equation whose elements belong
to D is as follows:
bi1j0?bi1j2+bi3j2?bi3j3+bi2j3?bi2j4+bi3j4?bi3j1+bi0j1?bi0j0 = ?(bi0j0?bi1j0)+(bi0j1?
bi3j1)?(bi1j2?bi3j2)+(bi2j3?bi3j3)?(bi2j4?bi3j4) = ?Dij0+Di?j1?Di??j2+Di???j3?Di???j4 .
As we see, the last two terms are an element of the matrix, DD. So, if it occurs in k-th
row and j-th column of DD then the equality ?Dij0+Di?j1?Di??j2+DDi???j = 0 provides
10-cycles.
Case 3: Submatrices which include five rows of the exponent matrix. Suppose they are
i0, i1, i2, i3 and i4.
7) Suppose three columns are j0, j1, j2. We provide the left side of the two Equations (1)
and their corresponding equations whose elements belong to D in order to show that this
item is similar to the item 5. So this item is omitted which declines the search space
significantly.
1) bi0j0?bi0j1+bi1j1?bi1j2+bi2j2?bi2j1+bi3j1?bi3j2+bi4j2?bi4j0 = (bi0j0?bi4j0)?(bi0j1?
bi3j1)? (bi3j2 ?bi4j2)+(bi1j1 ?bi2j1)? (bi1j2 ?bi2j2) = Dij0 ?Di?j1 ?Di??j2 ?Di???j1 ?Di???j2 .
DRAFT September 5, 2017
33
2) bi0j0?bi0j1+bi2j1?bi2j2+bi3j2?bi3j1+bi4j1?bi4j2+bi1j2?bi1j0 = (bi0j0?bi1j0)?(bi0j1?
bi2j1)? (bi2j2 ?bi3j2)+(bi1j2 ?bi4j2)? (bi3j1 ?bi4j1) = Dij0?Di?j1 ?Di??j2+Di???j1 ?Di????j2 .
8) Take 5 × 4 submatrices of the exponent matrix, where j0, j1, j2 and j3 are their four
columns. This item is also similar to item 5 and is omitted from the search.
To prove the second condition of the theorem we make use of items 4 to 8. According to
the examples provided in the mentioned items we result the condition.
9) If five columns are j0, j1, j2, j3, j4. In this item all elements of a 5 × 5 submatrix of
D are considered. If for every five elements which occur in the five rows and the five
columns the obtained expression from rearranging the left side of Equation (1) is non-zero
modular N then such submatrices do not provide 10-cycles. From this item we conclude
the third condition of the theorem.
