Secrecy Rate Region of Wiretap Interference
Channels with Energy Harvesting Receivers
Ali Kariminezhad, Student Member, IEEE, and Aydin Sezgin, Senior Member, IEEE
Abstract—The secrecy rate region of wiretap interference
channels under receiver energy harvesting constraint is studied.
The legitimate users are equipped with single transmit/receive
antennas, while the passive eavesdropper has multiple antennas.
To stay operational in the network, the legitimate receivers
demand energy alongside information, which is fulfilled by power
transmission and exploiting a power splitting receiver. In order
to achieve the secrecy rate region frontier, smart tuning of
the transmit power and receiver power splitting coefficient is
required. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to
optimize these parameters jointly in polynomial time. The secrecy
rate region characterization is formulated as a weighted max-
min optimization problem. This problem turns to be a non-
convex problem due to the non-convex constraint set. This
set is lower-bounded by a convex set which in consequence
results in an achievable suboptimal solution that is improved
iteratively. Finally, we compare the achievable secrecy rate region
of legitimate users with a weak and strong eavesdropper under
legitimate users’ energy harvesting constraints.
I. INTRODUCTION
Secrecy is one of the main concerns for future communica-
tion networks. This includes wireless sensor networks (WSN)
and Internet of Things (IoT) [1]. Moreover, due to an steadily
increased number of connected devices, the scarce spectrum
needs to be shared among multiple communication pairs.
These two facts motivate the study of the wiretap interference
channel [2]. In this channel, multiple communication pairs
communicate simultaneously over a common spectrum, which
imposes destructive interference at the receivers. Here, we
assume that the receivers treat the incident interference as
noise (TIN). Thus, the complexity of the receiver is kept
low. Note that in certain cases TIN is optimal in terms of
achievable rates [3], [4]. Further, a multi-antenna malicious
eavesdropper overhears the transmit signals of the legitimate
users with the goal of decoding the messages. This renders
the communication to be insecure.
Alongside secure information transfer, legitimate receivers
need to stay operational in the network as long as possible [5],
[6]. For instance, consider a WSN with limited energy supply
at the sensors. By deploying energy harvesting receivers, the
energy buffer can be charged wirelessly from energy sources,
e.g., solar energy. The main focus of this paper is to harvest
RF signal energy. The sensors with scarce energy supplies
face the trade-off in simultaneous information detection (ID)
and energy harvesting (EH). By time sharing between ID
chain and EH circuitry, information is extracted in one time
instant, while the energy can be harvested in another time

instant [7]. Exploiting multiple receive antennas at the sensors
makes simultaneous ID and EH feasible in spatial domain
by antenna switching. In a single antenna receiver, power
splitting (PS) allows simultaneous ID and EH. By PS, one
portion of received signal power undergoes the ID chain while
the other portion passes through the EH circuitry. Utilizing
power splitting receiver, the demanded energy is satisfied by
power transmission. Hence, the legitimate transmitters convey
energy alongside information. This concept is well-known
as simultaneous wireless information and power transmission
(SWIPT) [8]–[10].
In order to identify secure communication rate tuples in multi-
user networks, we need to characterize the achievable secrecy
rate region frontier. Achievable secrecy rate region frontier
of the wiretap interference channel with legitimate users’ EH
demands is a function of the transmit power and the receiver
power splitting coefficients at the legitimate users. Therefore,
for characterizing the secrecy rate region frontier, it is crucial
to study the joint interaction between transmit power and
splitting coefficients at multiple legitimate pairs. Thus, optimal
design which captures the trade-off between those parameters
needs to be investigated.
Contribution: In this letter, we investigate the secrecy rate
region of the wiretap interference channel with a weak and
strong multi-antenna eavesdropper, respectively, under legiti-
mate user energy harvesting constraints. The transmit power
and receiver power splitting coefficients are optimized jointly
in order to capture the trade-off between secure communica-
tion rates and energy demands.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider a wiretap interference channel where the legitimate
users are equipped with single antennas and the eavesdropper
exploits multiple antennas as shown in Fig.1. The channel
2
input-output relationships at the legitimate users and eaves-
dropper are given as
yk = hkkxk +
K
?
j=1
j 6=k
hkjxj + nk, ?k ? K, (1)
yE =
K
?
j=1
hEjxj + nE, (2)
where the set of legitimate users is denoted by K =
{1, ...,K}. The received signal at kth legitimate receiver and
the eavesdropper with M antennas are represented by yk ? C
and yE ? CM , respectively. The transmit signal from kth
transmitter is assumed to be from a Gaussian codebook and
is denoted by xk ? C. Moreover, zero-mean additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) at the kth legitimate receives and
at the eavesdropper are represented by nk ? CN
(
0, ?2k
)
and
nE ? CN
(
0, ?2EIM
)
, respectively. Channel realization from
jth transmitter to kth receiver is represented by hkj ? C, and
the channel from jth user to the eavesdropper is expressed by
hEj ? CM . These channels are assumed to be globally known.
Legitimate receivers harvest the energy of the incident radio
frequency (RF) signal by power splitting. Hence, a portion
of received signal power undergoes the information detection
(ID) chain and the other portion passes through the energy har-
vesting (EH) circuitry. Therefore, the achievable information
rate (by treating interference as noise) and harvested energy
are formulated as
Rk = log2

respectively, which guarantees reliable decoding with arbi-
trarily small decoding error. Notice that ?k is the power
splitting coefficient at the kth legitimate receiver. Moreover,
the transmit power from the kth transmitter is represented by
pk, i.e., E{|xk|2} = pk. Reliability is not the only concern
in wiretap interference channels as the secrecy needs to be
considered as well. The communication between kth pair of
legitimate users is proved to be reliable and secure [11] if
Rsk = Rk ?REk ? 0, ?k ? K, (5)
where Rk is defined in (3) and

Notice that uHk is the signal post processing vector at the
eavesdropper for obtaining the transmit signal from kth user.
Now, by transmitting with the secrecy coding rate in (5),
the legitimate receivers are able to decode the signals from
the corresponding transmitters reliably and securely. That
means, the eavesdropper fails in decoding the signals from
the legitimate transmitters.
Here, we assume that the eavesdropper deploys two receive
structures defined by its computational capabilities, namely
1) maximum ratio combining (MRC),
2) minimum mean-squared error and successive interference
cancellation (MMSE-SIC).
Note that MMSE-SIC corresponds with the optimal linear
reception at the eavesdropper. Hence, worst-case secrecy rates
are associated with this type of reception at the eavesdropper.
Secrecy Rate Region: By defining kth user achievable
secrecy rate in (5), the secrecy rate region of the wiretap
interference channel is defined as
Rs ,
?
pk?pkmax , ?k?K
0??k?1, ?k?K
{r|0 ? r ? r?s}, (7)
where pkmax is the available power budget at the kth legitimate
transmitter and r?s = [Rs1, ..., R
s
K ] specifies the outermost
achievable secrecy rate tuples. Notice that, the secrecy rate
region can be uniquely characterized by determining the rate
tuples on the boundary of the secrecy rate region. Deter-
mining these rates require optimal resource allocation at the
transmitter alongside receivers power splitting optimization.
In what follows, we present the achievable secrecy rate region
of the wiretap interference channel under energy harvesting
constraints of the legitimate users.
III. MRC AT THE EAVESDROPPER
In this section, we study the case that the eavesdropper uses
maximum ratio combining as the post processing vector, uk =

where p = [p1, ..., pK ] and ? = [?1, ..., ?K ]. Moreover,
pmax = [p1max , ..., pKmax ] is the power budget available at the
users. The energy harvesting constraint is given by (9a), where
1a ? b: vector a is less than or equal to vector b, if each element in a is
less than or equal to the corresponding element in b.

the energy demand of the kth user is represented by ?k. The
weight vector ? = [?1, ..., ?K ] is determined apriori with
0 ? ?k ? 1, ?k and ???1 = 1. Notice that, with each
realization of ? we obtain a secure achievable rate on the
rate region Pareto boundary. Hence, solving problem (9) for
each realization of ? ? RK with a predefined resolution,
delivers the secrecy rate region [12]. The Pareto boundary
represents the outermost boundary of the achievable secrecy
rate tuples, where by increasing the secrecy rate of one
user, the secrecy rate of at least one other user is inevitably
decreased. Problem (9) is a non-convex problem. This is due
to the non-convexity of the objective function, which is the
division of non-convex functions. By defining an auxiliary
variable ? = mink
Rsk
?k
, we transfer the objective function
into the constraint set. Then we obtain,

subject to ??k ? R

(9a), (9b), (9c). (10b)
We can reformulate constraints (10a) as

(11)
where we defined ? = 2? . Since ? is monotonically increasing
as a function of ? in optimization problem (10), we replace
? with ?. The energy harvesting constraints in (9a) are
reformulated as
?k + ?k
?K
j=1 pj |hkj |

?K
j=1 pj |hkj |

? 1. (12)
Hence, we obtain
max
?,?,p
? subject to (11), (12), (9b), (9c), (13)
The constraints (11) and (12) are divisions of posynomials,
which are not necessarily convex functions. This renders the
weighted max-min optimization problem into a signomial pro-
gram which is NP-hard problem [13]. Here, we approximate
the denominator of the functions in (11) and (12) with a
monomial function based on the single condensation method.
This approximation is based on the relation between arithmetic
and geometric means [14]. For instance, the denominator of
constraint (12) can be approximated as
K
?
j=1
pj|hkj |
2 ?
K
?
j=1
(
pj |hkj |2
ckj
)ckj
, (14)
where ckj , ?j, controls the approximation gap. Inequality (14)
holds with equality with the optimal value of ckj , ?j, which
is
c?kj =
pj |hkj |2
?K
j=1 pj |hkj |
2
. (15)
Similar approximation is applied for the denominator of (11).
Utilizing c?kj as a function of p renders the problem to be non-
convex, hence we resolve it iteratively. Here, we tighten the
approximation gap by optimizing over pj and ?j , ?j and using
the solutions to obtain c?kj . Notice that this c
?
kj is optimal only
for the current iteration and suboptimal for the next iteration.
Lemma 1. Exploiting MRC at the eavesdropper results
in the worst-case achievable secrecy rates for any given
?hEk?
2, ?k ? K, if and only if M ? K and
hEk = Null
(
hE1 , ...hEk?1 ,hEk+1 ,hEK
)
, ?k ? K, (16)
where Null
(
hE1 , ...hEk?1 ,hEk+1 ,hEK
)
represents the null
space of the subspace spanned by hE1 , ...hEk?1 ,hEk+1 ,hEK .
Proof. Having M ? K , provides sufficient dimensions for
the probability that the channels are orthogonal to each other.
For orthogonal channels from the legitimate transmitters to
the eavesdropper, MRC simultaneously nulls the interference
and maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Therefore,
REk , ?k is maximized which in consequence minimizes
Rsk, ?k.
The occurrence of the orthogonal channels given in (16)
is of measure zero (almost never happens) assuming limited
number of antennas at the eavesdropper. Therefore, it is of
importance to investigate the worst-case secrecy rate region
for arbitrary channel realizations. For any given channel
realization, among all linear receivers, utilizing MMSE-SIC
at the eavesdropper delivers the secrecy rate region lower-
bound which is going to be discussed in the following section.
IV. MMSE AND SIC AT THE EAVESDROPPER
In this section, we assume that the eavesdropper is capable
of performing MMSE-SIC at the signal combining stage. Thus,
the signal combining vector uk, ?k that minimizes the mean
of the squared-error is
ummsek =
?
?
K
?
j=k+1
pjhEjh
H
Ej
+ ?2EI
?
?
?1
hEk , ?k ? K. (17)
As can be seen from (17), the MMSE signal combining is
a function of the power allocation performed at the legitimate
receivers. Hence, we assume that the eavesdropper
1) knows neither the power budget nor the transmit power
at the legitimate users: MMSE with pj = 1, ?j,
2) only knows the power budget at the legitimate users:
MMSE with pj = pjmax , ?j,
3) knows the actual transmit power at the legitimate users:
MMSE with pj = p
?
j , ?j.
The first two assumptions are trivial and we only present the
simulation results in section V. However, the last assumption
provides the worst-case secrecy rate region, which is dis-
cussed in this section. By utilizing ummsek , ?k as a function
of pj , ?j, and performing SIC, the kth legitimate user’s
achievable secrecy rate is formulated similar to (6). Now,
we formulate the weighted max-min optimization problem

receiver AWGN variance is SINRTk = 5, ?k ? K
similar to problem (13) to obtain the secrecy rate region. This
problem becomes non-convex in the optimization variables,
?,p,?. Here, we propose an approach with inner and outer
iterations to obtain a suboptimal solution, which is improved
iteratively. In this approach, the transmit power p, the receiver
power splitting coefficients ? and the auxiliary variable ? is
optimized in an inner iteration loop. However, the MMSE
signal combining vector is optimized in an outer iteration
loop. This procedure in elaborated in Algorithm I in details.
It is important to mention that the decoding order at the
eavesdropper is not captured in the optimization framework.
Here, we compare the solutions of all decoding order that is
K ! combinations and the convex hull of all achievable rate
tuples delivers the secrecy rate region.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
We consider two legitimate users that are wiretapped by an
eavesdropper equipped with two antennas, i.e., K = M = 2.
The ratio between transmit signal power budget and receiver
AWGN variance over legitimate and eavesdropper channels
are assumed to be equal to 5, i.e., SINRTk =
pkmax
?2
=
pkmax
?2E
=
5, ?k ? K. Secure communication should be guaranteed under
energy harvesting constraints at the legitimate receivers. By
solving optimization problem (13) with the proposed iterative
method, we obtain the secrecy rate region with MRC at
the eavesdropper. Assuming MMSE-SIC at the eavesdropper,
the Pareto boundary of the achievable secrecy rate region
is obtained by Algorithm 1. Notice that, these optimization
problems need to be solved for ? ? A = {? ? R2|? ?
0, ???1 = 1}. In Fig. 2(a), the average achievable secrecy
rate region assuming an eavesdropper with MRC capability is
compared to the worst-case scenario from lemma 1. There, we
observe the convexity of the worst-case secrecy rate region for
the case that the legitimate users channel strength is equal to
the eavesdropper channel strength. Furthermore we compare
the secrecy rate region assuming MRC and MMSE-SIC at
the eavesdropper in Fig. 2(b). In that figure, we observe the
performance gap of MRC compared to MMSE-SIC from the
secrecy rate perspective. Moreover, simultaneous transmission
with power control at the transmitters and optimal power split-
ting tuning at the receiver outperforms time sharing between
the users. This performance gap is enlarged with increasing
energy harvesting demands. Furthermore, the shrinkage of the
achievable secrecy rate region as a function of energy demands
at the legitimate receivers is worth noting. Notice that, the
worst-case scenario is only for performance comparison. That
means higher secrecy rate tuples are always achievable due
to the absence of optimal power allocation knowledge at the
eavesdropper. This can be seen in Fig. 2(c), where eavesdrop-
per does not access the legitimate users’ transmit power, when
decoding kth user’s signal. Hence, MMSE is performed by
assuming pj = 1 and pj = pjmax , ?j ? {k + 1, ...,K}.
Moreover, given the actual transmit power of the legitimate
users at the eavesdropper as a side information, the secrecy
rate region is not enlarged significantly.
