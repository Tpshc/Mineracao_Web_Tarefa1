Abstract—In this paper, we examine the secrecy performance
of two-way relaying between a multiple antenna base station
(BS) and a single antenna mobile user (MU) in the presence
of a multiple antenna friendly jammer (FJ). We consider the
untrusted relaying scenario where an amplify-and-forward relay
is both a necessary helper and a potential eavesdropper. To
maximize the instantaneous secrecy sum rate, we derive new
closed-form solutions for the optimal power allocation (OPA)
between the BS and MU under the scenario of relaying with
friendly jamming (WFJ). Based on the OPA solution, new closed-
form expressions are derived for the ergodic secrecy sum rate
(ESSR) with Rayleigh fading channel. Furthermore, we explicitly
determine the high signal-to-noise ratio slope and power offset of
the ESSR to highlight the benefits of friendly jamming. Numerical
examples are provided to demonstrate the impact of the FJ’s
location and number of antennas on the secrecy performance.
I. INTRODUCTION
RELAYING is a proven approach to improve energyefficiency, extend coverage and increase the throughput
of wireless communication networks. Recently, the benefits
of relaying have been viewed from the viewpoint of wireless
physical-layer security (PLS) [1]. A key area of interest is
the untrusted relaying scenario where the source-to-destination
transmission is assisted by a relay which may also be a
potential eavesdropper [2]. This scenario occurs in large-
scale wireless systems such as heterogeneous networks and
device-to-device (D2D) communications, where confidential
messages are often retransmitted by intermediate nodes.
Secure transmission utilizing an untrusted relay was first
studied in [3], where an achievable secrecy rate was derived. In
[4], it was found that introducing a friendly jammer (FJ) could
result in a positive secrecy rate for a one-way untrusted relay
link with no direct source-destination transmission. Indeed,
many recent papers on untrusted relay communications have
focussed on the one-way relaying scenario [5]– [7]. Recently,
several works have considered the more interesting scenario
of two-way untrusted relaying [8]-[10] where physical-layer
network coding can provide security enhancement since the
relay receives a superimposed signal from the two sources
instead of each individual signal [11].
Considering two-way untrusted relaying, [8] proposed a
game-theoretic power control scheme between the two single
antenna sources and multiple FJs. In the proposed scheme, the
optimal jamming power was derived for the special case where
the FJ is very close to the amplify-and-forward (AF) relay. In
[9], multiple antennas were considered at the sources and a
joint optimization of transmit covariance matrices and relay
selection was proposed for AF relaying without FJs. In [10],
an iterative algorithm was proposed to jointly optimize the
multiple antenna sources and AF relay beamformers such that
the instantaneous secrecy sum rate without FJs is maximized.
In this paper, we investigate the PLS of a two-way untrusted
AF relaying system, where a multiple antenna base station
(BS) exchanges confidential messages with a single antenna
mobile user (MU) in the presence of a multiple antenna
FJ. The relay is considered to be both a necessary helper
and a potential curious eavesdropper. For this system, we
analyze the secrecy performance under the scenario of relaying
with friendly jamming (WFJ). In particular, we formulate the
optimal power allocation (OPA) between the BS and MU that
maximizes the instantaneous secrecy sum rate of two-way
untrusted relaying. Based on this, we derive a new closed-
form solution for the OPA in the large-scale multiple antenna
(LSMA) regime for the BS and FJ. According to our OPA
solution, the ergodic secrecy sum rate (ESSR) of the optimized
system is derived for Rayleigh fading channel. We further
characterize the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) slope and the
high SNR power offset of the ESSR which explicitly captures
the impact of the distance dependent channel gains and the
number of BS and FJ antennas on the ESSR. Finally, numerical
results are provided to reveal the secrecy performance advan-
tage of the OPA scheme compared with equal power allocation
and without friendly jamming. We highlight the significant
ESSR advantage of employing a FJ and the impacts of the FJ
location and number of BS and FJ antennas on the ESSR.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a two-way relay network as depicted in Fig. 1
where a BS and MU exchange information via an untrusted
AF relay. Depending on the required secrecy sum rate for the
BS and MU, a FJ may be employed to transmit noise-like
jamming signals to the relay. The BS and FJ are equipped
with NBS and NFJ antennas, respectively, while the relay and
MU are equipped with a single antenna. Similar to [8], we
consider that the FJ is an external power seller that may be
activated to boost the secrecy sum rate of the BS and MU.
The two-way relaying transmission is performed in two
phases. In Phase 1, shown with solid lines, both the BS and
MU transmit their information to the relay. Simultaneously, the
FJ can be activated to transmit jamming signals to the relay.
In Phase 2, shown with dashed lines, the relay broadcasts a
combined version of the received signals to the BS and MU.
Based on knowledge of its own signal and the FJ’s jamming

signal, the BS and MU extracts the information signal from
its opposite counterpart. To utilize the multiple antennas, we
apply maximum ratio transmission (MRT) at the BS and FJ
in Phase 1, and maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the BS
in Phase 2.
We consider a total transmit power budget for the BS and
MU of P with power allocation factor ? ? (0, 1) such that
the transmit powers at the BS and MU are ?P and (1??)P ,
respectively. For simplicity, the transmit power at the relay and
the FJ are set to P . The complex Gaussian channel vectors
from the BS to relay, MU to relay and FJ to relay are denoted
by hbr ? CN (0NBS×1, µbrINBS×1), hmr ? CN (0, µmr) and
hfr ? CN (0NFJ×1, µfrINFJ×1), respectively, where 0 is the
zero matrix, I is the identity matrix, and µbr, µmr, µfr are
the channel gains based on the distance-dependent path loss
for each antenna branch. We define ?br = ??hbr?2, ?mr =
?|hmr|2 and ?fr = ??hfr?2 where ? = P?2n and the additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at all nodes are zero-mean with
variance ?2n. Also ?br = ?µbr, ?mr = ?µmr and ?fr = ?µfr.
Let x1 and x2 denote the transmitted scalar symbols from
the BS and MU, respectively. In Phase 1, the received signal
at the relay is expressed as
yR=
?
?P?hbr?x1+
?
(1? ?)Phmrx2+
?
P?hfr?xfj+nR, (1)
where xfj and nr represent the jamming signal and the AWGN
at the relay, respectively.
In Phase 2, the relay amplifies its received signal in (1) by
an amplification factor of
G =
?
P
?P?hbr?2 + (1? ?)P |hmr|2 + P?hfr?2 + ?2n
, (2)
and transmits a broadcast signal to the BS and MU given by
xR = GyR. After canceling the self interference and jamming
signals in yR, the corresponding received signals at the BS
and MU are given by
yBS=
?
(1? ?)PGhbrhmrx2 +GhbrnR + nBS, (3)
yMU=
?
?PG?hbr?hmrx1 +GhmrnR + nMU, (4)
respectively, where nBS and nMU are the AWGN at the BS
and MU, respectively.
Based on (3) and (4), and using (2), the signal-to-
interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) at the BS (after per-
forming MRC) and at the MU are given by
?BS=
(1? ?)?br?mr
(1 + ?)?br + (1 ? ?)?mr + ?fr + ?
, (5)
?MU=
??br?mr
??br + (2? ?)?mr + ?fr + ?
, (6)
respectively, where ? = 1. Based on (1), the SINR at the
untrusted relay is given by
?R=
??br + (1 ? ?)?mr
?fr + ?
, (7)
where we assume that the relay performs multiuser decoding to
estimate the signals from the BS and MU. We adopt the well-
known SINR approximation of ? = 0 and note that from a
security perspective this corresponds to the maximum intercept
probability for the relay SINR in (7). From (5)–(7), we can
conclude that the jamming signal decreases all the SINR terms
but as observed in the next section, it has a more dominant
impact on the relay SINR.
The instantaneous secrecy sum rate of the two-way un-
trusted relaying system is given by [9] Rs = [IBS + IMU ?
IR]
+, where IK =
1
2 log2(1 + ?K) is the achievable rate at
source K ? {BS ,MU}, IR = 12 log2(1+ ?R) is the informa-
tion leaked to the untrusted relay, and [x]+ = max{0, x}. As
such, the instantaneous secrecy sum rate can be re-expressed
as Rs =
[
1
2 log2 ?(?)
]+
, where
?(?) =
(1 + ?BS)(1 + ?MU)
1 + ?R
. (8)
III. OPTIMAL POWER ALLOCATION FOR SECRECY SUM
RATE MAXIMIZATION
In this section, we derive the OPA at the BS and MU that
maximizes the instantaneous secrecy sum rate. Indeed, we
need to consider the following optimization problem
?? = arg max?(?), s.t. 0 < ? < 1 (9)
Note that ?(?) is a quasi-concave function of ? in the feasible
set. As such, by taking the derivative of ?(?) w.r.t. ? and
setting it to zero, the OPA when ?br ? ?mr is derived as
??=
?2?mr??fr+?mr
?
2?2mr+3?mr?fr?2?mr+?2fr??fr
?br?mr
. (10)
To obtain further insights from (10), we consider the case
where ?fr ? ?mr and ?mr ? 1 which results in
?? =
?fr
?br
. (11)
This OPA applies to the case of high SNRs in both the relay-
to-jammer link and the relay-to-MU link. Note that ?fr ?
?mr occurs when the number of antennas at the FJ NFJ is
significantly large, or the relay is located much closer to the FJ
compared to the MU. It is also worth of noting that while we
have considered LSMA at both the BS and the FJ in deriving
(11), NBS should be larger than NFJ to ensure that ? < 1.

IV. ERGODIC SECRECY SUM RATE ANALYSIS
In this section, we apply the OPA solution (11) to derive new
closed-form expressions for the ESSR of two-way untrusted
relaying. Recall that the ESSR can be expressed as [9]
Rs=

2 ln 2

{

}

}
? ?? ?
I3
]
. (12)
As such, in the following subsections, we proceed to evaluate
the ESSR terms of I1, I2 and I3.
Substituting ?? in (11) into (5)–(7), the SINRs at the BS,
MU and relay for ?br ? ?mr and ?mr ? 1 yields
?BS = ?mr
1? ?fr
?br
1 + 2?fr
?br
, ?MU =
?mr
2
and ?R = 1. (13)
To derive the ESSR term of I1, we use Lemma 3 in
[15] where the exponential integral function Ei(?x) [13] is
expressed as a closed-form solution as
Ei(?x) ? ?4

cot(?p?1(q?1))?cot(?p(q))
?p(q)??p?1(q?1)
, and .065 < ?1 < ... < ?T+1(T ?+1).
T and T ? are positive integers that control the accuracy of the
approximation.
Using (13) and (14), I1 is obtained as (see Appendix A)

. According to ?MU
in (13) and using [11, Eq. (4.331.2)], I2 can be obtained as
I2 = E
{

, (16)
and finally, using ?R in (13), I3 is given by
I3 = E
{
ln(1 + ?R)
}
= ln 2. (17)
We can further evaluate the asymptotic ESSR when ? ? ?
by applying the general asymptotic form given by [12]
R?s = S?
(
log2 ?? L?
)
, (18)
where S? is the high SNR slope in bits/s/Hz/ (3 dB) and L?
is the high SNR power offset in 3 dB units, which are defined
respectively as
S? = lim

. (19)
Based on (13), in the high SNR regime with ? ? ?, we
have ln(1+ ?BS) ? ln(?BS) and ln(1+ ?MU) ? ln(?MU). As
such, we can evaluate I1 and I2 as follows

Expression (28) shows that the power offset of WFJ depends
on both NFJ and NBS. As expected, we see that increasing the
number of BS antennas NBS decreases the ESSR power offset
which corresponds to an increase in the ESSR. Interestingly,
our results reveal that increasing the number of FJ antennas
NFJ actually increases the ESSR power offset which corre-
sponds to a decrease in the ESSR.
V. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES
This section provides numerical examples to verify the
accuracy of the derived ESSR expressions. We compare our
LSMA-based ESSR performance with the exact ESSR where
the OPA is numerically evaluated for finite numbers of BS and
FJ antennas using the bisection method. We also evaluate the
equal power allocation (EPA) between the BS and MU (i.e.,
? = 0.5) and the scenario without friendly jamming (WoFJ)
where the power is distributed optimally between the users.
To verify the accuracy of the derived LSMA-based ESSR
expressions in (15)–(17) and (24), we conduct the following
simulations in Figs. 2 and 3 [8]: For simplicity and without
loss of generality, we assume that the BS, the MU, the relay
and the FJ are located at (?1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0) and (0.3, 0.4),
respectively. Moreover, the path loss factor is ? = 2.
Fig. 2 shows the ESSR versus ? in dB for NBS = 64
and NFJ = 1. As can be observed from the figure: 1) The

medium and high transmit SNRs, 2) The SNR gap between
the optimized network and EPA is approximately 4.3 dB
compared to WFJ when the ESSR is 5 bits/s/Hz, and 3) The
optimized WFJ significantly improves the ESSR performance
compared to the optimized WoFJ. For example, for a target
ESSR of 5 bits/s/Hz, the SNR advantage of WFJ over WoFJ
is approximately 18 dB which reveals the clear advantage of
using a FJ to establish an energy-efficient secure network.
Fig. 3 depicts the ESSR versus ? in dB for NBS = 256 and
different values of NFJ = 4, 8, 16. We set T = T
? = 20. As
can be seen from the figure, the Monte Carlo simulation of the
exact ESSR matches precisely with the ESSR expression in
(15)–(17) and is well-approximated by the asymptotic ESSR
expression in (24) in the high SNR regime. Furthermore, we
note that the ESSR decreases with increasing NFJ which can
be explained by the fact that the high-SNR power offset L?
that was derived in (28) increases with increasing NFJ.

In Fig. 4, we examine the effect of the FJ location and
the number of FJ and BS antennas on the ESSR. The figure
highlights that for a given FJ location and number of BS
antennas, there is an optimal number of FJ antennas that
maximizes the ESSR. For example, when NBS = 64 and
d = 0.5, the ESSR is maximized when NFJ = 2. For a fixed FJ
location, we see that NFJ must increase with increasing NBS
to achieve a higher ESSR. This is because the received SINR
at the relay increases with increasing NBS with MRT at the
BS. By employing a FJ with more antennas, the information
leakage to the relay can be reduced.
VI. CONCLUSION
We examined the OPA and ESSR of a two-way relaying
network including a BS, a MU, an untrusted relay and a FJ. We
considered the BS and FJ are equipped with multiple antennas
denoted as NBS and NFJ, respectively, and derived the OPA
between the BS and the MU such that the instantaneous
secrecy sum rate of the network is maximized. Based on
the OPA solution, new closed-form ESSR expressions were
derived for the optimized WFJ network in the LSMA regime.
Our asymptotic ESSR expressions highlighted that the ESSR
of WFJ depends on the number of antennas NBS and NFJ.
Numerical results revealed that exploiting a FJ improves the
ESSR significantly compared to without friendly jamming.

along with [11, Eq. (3.352.2)] and [11, Eq. (3.351.4)], the
result in (15) can be achieved after simple manipulations.

Using [11, Eq. (4.352.2)], I1,1 is obtained as (21). Further-
more, using the pdf of ?fb in (29), I1,2 is derived as

Using [13, Eq. (2.727.1)] and the partial fraction
decomposition of [13, Eq. (2.101)], I1,2 is computed as
shown in (22). The third part I1,3 can be calculated in the
same way as I1,2 and the final expression can be found in (23).
