APPLICATION OF SIGNAL ANALYSIS TO THE EMBEDDING
PROBLEM OF Zk-ACTIONS
YONATAN GUTMAN, YIXIAO QIAO, MASAKI TSUKAMOTO
Abstract. We study the problem of embedding arbitrary Zk-actions into the shift
action on the infinite dimensional cube
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
. We prove that if a Zk-action X
satisfies the marker property (in particular if X is a minimal system without periodic
points) and if its mean dimension is smaller than D/2 then we can embed it in the
shift on
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
. The value D/2 here is optimal. The proof goes through signal
analysis. We develop the theory of encoding Zk-actions into band-limited signals and
apply it to proving the above statement. Main technical difficulties come from higher
dimensional phenomena in signal analysis. We overcome them by exploring analytic
techniques tailored to our dynamical settings. The most important new idea is to encode
the information of a tiling of Rk into a band-limited function which is constructed from
another tiling.
1. Introduction
1.1. Background. The main purpose of this paper is to deepen interactions between
signal analysis and dynamical systems. (This subsection is just a motivation. So readers
can skip unfamiliar/undefined terminologies.) If we think of signal analysis in a broad
sense (like signal analysis ? Fourier analysis), then applications of signal analysis are
ubiquitous in ergodic theory. For example, Fourier analysis proof of the unique ergodicity
of the irrational rotation (due to Weyl) is a milestone of such applications. But here
we would like to think of signal analysis in a narrower sense, say signal analysis is a
part of communication theory. From this viewpoint, a masterpiece is Shannon’s work on
communications over band-limited channels with Gaussian noise ([Sha48], [CT06, Chapter
9]): Suppose that we try to send information by using signals (say, of telephone line) whose
frequencies are limited in [?W/2,W/2]. If the averaged power of signal is P and if the
noise is additive white Gaussian noise of spectral density N , then the capacity of the
channel (i.e. the amount of information we can send by using this channel) is given by

The details of this formula are not important here. We just would like to emphasize
that the band-width W is a crucial parameter in the communications over band-limited
channels.
Recently the first and third named authors [GT] found an analogous theory in the
context of topological dynamics. They started the theory of encoding arbitrary dynamical
systems into band-limited signals and applied it to solving an open problem posed by
Lindenstrauss [Lin99] in 1999. The purpose of the present paper is to expand this theory
to multi-dimensional case.
1.2. Encoding into discrete signals. We start from a problem seemingly unrelated to
signal analysis. Let k be a natural number. A triple (X,Zk, T ) (often abbreviated to X)
is called a dynamical system if X is a compact metric space and
T : Zk ×X ? X, (n, x) 7? T nx
is a continuous action. A fundamental example of dynamical systems is the shift action
on the infinite dimensional cube. Let D be a natural number. Consider the infinite
product
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
. Let ? : Zk ×
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk ?
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
be the shift:
?m ((xn)n?Zk) = (xn+m)n?Zk .
The triple
((
[0, 1]D
)Zk
,Zk, ?
)
is a dynamical system and called the shift on
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
.
We study the old problem of embedding arbitrary dynamical systems in the shift on(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
. Let (X,Zk, T ) be a dynamical system. A map f : X ?
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
is called
an embedding of a dynamical system if f is a Zk-equivariant continuous injection. We
would like to understand when X can be embedded in the shift on
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
. Notice that
every compact metric space can be topologically embedded in
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
. So the problem
is a genuinely dynamical question.
It will be convenient later to see the problem from a slightly different viewpoint: A point
x = (xn)n?Zk in
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
can be seen as a discrete signal1 valued in [0, 1]D. Then the
embedding problem asks when we can encode a given dynamical system X into discrete
signals.
We review the history of the problem before explaining our main result (Main Theorem
1 below). The embedding problem was first studied by Jaworski [Jaw74] in 1974. For
understanding his result, notice that periodic points form an obvious obstruction to the
embedding. For example, the shift on ([0, 1]2)
Zk
cannot be embedded in the shift on
[0, 1]Z
k
because the fixed points sets of ([0, 1]2)
Zk
and [0, 1]Z
k
are homeomorphic to the

EMBEDDING PROBLEM OF Zk-ACTIONS 3
square [0, 1]2 and the line segment [0, 1] respectively and the square cannot be topologically
embedded in the line segment.
A dynamical system (X,Zk, T ) is said to be aperiodic if T nx 6= x for all x ? X and
nonzero n ? Zk. Jaworski [Jaw74] proved that periodic points are the only obstruction if
X is a finite dimensional system:
Theorem 1.1 (Jaworski, 1974). Let (X,Z, T ) be an aperiodic finite dimensional dynam-
ical system. Then we can embed it in the shift on [0, 1]Z.
Although this theorem is stated only for Z-actions, it can be easily generalized to Zk-
actions. (Indeed the Zk-case can be deduced from the Z-case.)
After Jaworski, people were interested in whether the assumption of finite dimension-
ality is essential or not. Auslander [Aus88, p. 193] asked whether we can embed every
minimal system (X,Z, T ) in the shift on [0, 1]Z. A system (X,Zk, T ) is said to be mini-
mal if the orbit {T nx}n?Zk is dense in X for every x ? X . When k = 1, minimal systems
X have no periodic points unless X is a finite set. (If X is finite, then it can be obviously
embedded in the shift on [0, 1]Z.) Therefore the question essentially asks whether there is
another obstruction different from periodic points.
Lindenstrauss–Weiss [LW00] found that mean dimension provides a new obstruction to
the embedding. Mean dimension (first introduced by Gromov [Gro99]) is a topological
invariant of dynamical systems which counts the average number of parameters of a
given system. The mean dimension of (X,Zk, T ) is denoted by mdim(X). We review its
definition in Subsection 2.1. Finite dimensional systems and finite topological entropy
systems are known to have zero mean dimension.
The mean dimension of the shift on
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
is equal to D, which means that
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
has D parameters in average. If (X,Zk, T ) can be embedded in the shift
on
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
then mdim(X) ? D. Lindenstrauss–Weiss [LW00, Proposition 3.5] con-
structed a minimal system (X,Z, T ) of mean dimension strictly greater than one. This
system cannot be embedded in the shift on [0, 1]Z although it is minimal. Thus it solved
Auslander’s question.
Lindenstrauss went further; he proved a partial converse [Lin99, Theorem 5.1].
Theorem 1.2 (Lindenstrauss, 1999). If a minimal system (X,Z, T ) satisfies mdim(X) <
D/36 then we can embed it in the shift on
(
[0, 1]D
)Z
.
Lindenstrauss [Lin99, p. 229] asked the problem of improving the condition mdim(X) <
D/36. This problem was solved by the first and third named authors [GT, Theorem 1.4]:
Theorem 1.3 (Gutman–Tsukamoto). If a minimal system (X,Z, T ) satisfiesmdim(X) <
D/2 then we can embed it in the shift on
(
[0, 1]D
)Z
.
The condition mdim(X) < D/2 is optimal because there exists a minimal system
(X,Z, T ) of mean dimension D/2 which cannot be embedded in the shift on
(
[0, 1]D
)Z
4 YONATAN GUTMAN, YIXIAO QIAO, MASAKI TSUKAMOTO
([LT14]). Theorem 1.3 can be seen as a dynamical analogue of the classical theorem in
dimension theory [HW41, Thm. V2]: A compact metric space X can be topologically
embedded in [0, 1]D if dimX < D/2. We review the proof of this classical result in
Subsection 2.3.
A motivation of the present paper is to generalize Theorem 1.3 to Zk-actions. It is
convenient to introduce the following notion. A dynamical system (X,Zk, T ) is said to
satisfy the marker property if for every natural number N there exists an open set
U ? X satisfying
U ? T?nU = ? (0 < |n| < N), X =
?
n?Zk
T?nU.
This property obviously implies the aperiodicity. The following dynamical systems are
known to satisfy the marker property:
• Aperiodic minimal systems. (This is an immediate fact from the definition.)
• Aperiodic finite dimensional systems ([Gut12, Theorem 6.1])2.
• If X satisfies the marker property and if ? : Y ? X is an extension (i.e. Zk-
equivariant continuous surjection) then Y also satisfies the marker property.
The authors do not know an example of aperiodic actions which do not satisfy the marker
property.
Lindenstrauss and the first and third named authors [GLT16, Theorem 1.5] proved:
Theorem 1.4 (Gutman–Lindenstrauss–Tsukamoto, 2016). If a dynamical system (X,Zk, T )
satisfies the marker property and
mdim(X) <
D
2k+1
then we can embed it in the shift on
(
[0, 1]2D
)Zk
.
After stating this theorem, the paper [GLT16] posed the problem of improving the
condition mdim(X) < D/2k+1. Quoting [GLT16, p. 782]:
Note also that in our condition mdim(X) < D/2k+1, the constant in-
volved is likely far from optimal. Presumably for an aperiodic Zk-system
if mdim(X) < D
2
then X can be embedded in ([0, 1]D)Z
k
.
The first main theorem of the present paper confirms this conjecture under the assump-
tion of the marker property:
2More generally, we can prove that if an aperiodic dynamical system satisfies the small boundary
property then it satisfies the marker property. The small boundary property is a notion introduced
by Lindenstrauss–Weiss [LW00, Definition 5.2], which is satisfied by every aperiodic finite dimensional
system. We do not use these facts. So we omit the detailed explanation.
EMBEDDING PROBLEM OF Zk-ACTIONS 5
Main Theorem 1. If a dynamical system (X,Zk, T ) satisfies the marker property and
mdim(X) <
D
2
,
then we can embed it in the shift on
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
.
As in the case of Theorem 1.3, the condition mdim(X) < D/2 is optimal because
the paper [LT14]3 provides an example of aperiodic minimal system (X,Zk, T ) of mean
dimension D/2 which cannot be embedded in the shift on
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
. Main Theorem
1 has some novelty even in the case of k = 1: Since both aperiodic finite dimensional
systems and aperiodic minimal systems satisfy the marker property, Main Theorem 1
unifies Jaworski’s theorem (Theorem 1.1) and Theorem 1.3 into a single statement.
1.3. Encoding into band-limited signals. A discovery of the paper [GT] is that we
can approach to the embedding problem in Subsection 1.2 via signal analysis. We need
to prepare some terminologies. For a rapidly decreasing function ? : Rk ? C we define
its Fourier transforms by
F(?)(?) = ??(?) =
?
Rk
?(t) e?2?
?
?1t·? dt1 . . . dtk,
F(?)(t) = ??(t) =
?
Rk
?(?) e2?
?
?1t·?d?1 . . . d?k.
It follows that F
(
F(?)
)
= F (F(?)) = ?. We extend F and F to tempered distributions
? by the dualities ?F(?), ?? = ??,F(?)? and ?F(?), ?? = ??,F(?)? where ? are rapidly
decreasing functions (Schwartz [Sch66, Chapter 7]). For example, if ?(t) = e2?
?
?1a·t
(a ? Rk) then F(?) = ?a is the delta probability measure at a.
Let a1, . . . , ak be positive numbers. A bounded continuous function ? : R
k ? R is
said to be band-limited in [?a1/2, a1/2]× · · · × [?ak/2, ak/2] if the Fourier transform ??
satisfies

which means that ???, ?? = ??, ??? = 0 for all rapidly decreasing functions ? satisfying

For example, when k = 1, the functions
sin(?t1), cos(?t1),
sin(?t1)
?t1
are band-limited in [?1/2, 1/2].
We define B(a1, . . . , ak) as the Banach space of all bounded continuous functions ? :
Rk ? R band-limited in [?a1/2, a1/2] × · · · × [?ak/2, ak/2]. Its norm is the L?-norm.
3Strictly speaking, the paper [LT14] considered only the case of k = 1. But their construction can be
generalized to Zk-actions without any changes.

We define B1(a1, . . . , ak) as the set of ? ? B(a1, . . . , ak) satisfying ||?||L?(Rk) ? 1. In this
paper we promise that the space B1(a1, . . . , ak) is always endowed with the topology of
uniform convergence over compact subsets. Namely B1(a1, . . . , ak) is endowed with
the topology given by the distance
d(?, ?) =
??
n=1
2?n ||?? ?||L?(Bn) ,
(
Bn = {t ? Rk| |t| ? n}
)
.
B1(a1, . . . , ak) is compact (see Corollary 2.3 below) and endowed with a natural continuous
action of Zk defined by
? : Zk × B1(a1, . . . , ak) ? B1(a1, . . . , ak), ?n(?)(t) = ?(t+ n).
We call the dynamical system (B1(a1, . . . , ak),Zk, ?) the shift on B1(a1, . . . , ak). Its mean
dimension is equal to the product4
a1 . . . ak,
which is a multi-dimensional version of band-width W introduced in Subsection 1.1. As
band-width W plays a crucial role in Shannon’s theory, the quantity a1 . . . ak becomes a
key parameter below.
We consider the problem of embedding arbitrary dynamical systems in the shift on
B1(a1, . . . , ak). In other words we ask when we can encode a given dynamical system into
band-limited signals. When k = 1, the first and third named authors [GT, Theorem 1.7]
proved:
Theorem 1.5 (Gutman–Tsukamoto). If an aperiodic minimal system (X,Z, T ) satisfies
mdim(X) < a1/2 then we can embed it in the shift on B1(a1).
The second main theorem of the present paper generalizes this theorem to the higher
dimensional case:
Main Theorem 2. If a dynamical system (X,Zk, T ) satisfies the marker property and
mdim(X) <
a1 . . . ak
2
,
then we can embed it in the shift on B1(a1, . . . , ak).
As in the case of Main Theorem 1, the condition mdim(X) < a1 . . . ak/2 is optimal
because a modification of [LT14] provides an aperiodic minimal system (X,Zk, T ) of
mean dimension a1 . . . ak/2 which cannot be embedded in the shift on B1(a1, . . . , ak).
We can prove Main Theorem 1 by using Main Theorem 2.
Proof: Main Theorem 2 implies Main Theorem 1. From mdim(X) < D/2 we can choose
positive numbers a1, . . . , ak satisfying
a1 < D, a2 < 1, . . . , ak < 1, mdim(X) <
a1 . . . ak
2
.
4This fact is not used in the paper. So we omit the proof.
EMBEDDING PROBLEM OF Zk-ACTIONS 7
Main Theorem 2 implies that we can embed X in the shift on B1(a1, . . . , ak). We define
a lattice ? ? Rk by
? =
{(n1
D
, n2, . . . , nk
)???n1, n2 . . . , nk ? Z
}
.
It follows from a sampling theorem (see Lemma 2.4 below) that the map
B1(a1, . . . , ak) ? [?1, 1]?, ? 7? ?|?
is injective. Set e = (1/D, 0, . . . , 0) ? Rk. The above injectivity means that the Zk-
equivariant map
B1(a1, . . . , ak) ?
(
[?1, 1]D
)Zk
, ? 7? (?(n), ?(n+ e), . . . , ? (n+ (D ? 1)e))n?Zk
is an embedding. Since the system X can be embedded in the shift on B1(a1, . . . , ak), it
can be also embedded in the shift on
(
[?1, 1]D
)Zk
, which is obviously isomorphic to the
shift on
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
. 
1.4. One dimension versus multi-dimension; what are the main difficulties?
This subsection explains what are the main difficulties in the proof of Main Theorem 2.
When the authors started the research of this paper, they optimistically thought that the
proof of Main Theorem 2 is probably more or less a direct generalization of the proof
of Theorem 1.5 in [GT]. This expectation turned out to be wrong. Completely new
difficulties arose in the context of signal analysis. The paper [GT] used the technique of
one dimensional signal analysis. The proof of Main Theorem 2 uses mutli-dimensional
signal analysis. The difference of one dimension/multi-dimension is fundamental and
causes big changes of the approaches significantly.
We review some basic signal analysis in Subsection 2.2 below. The main results there
are Paley–Wiener’s theorem (Lemma 2.2) and a sampling theorem (Lemma 2.4) for func-
tions in B(a1, . . . , ak), whose proofs are a simple generalization of (or a reduction to) the
corresponding theorems in one-variable case. They might give readers an impression that
multi-dimensional signal analysis is just a simple generalization of one-dimensional signal
analysis. This is far from being true. It is well-known in classical analysis community
(cf. [OU12]) that multi-dimensional signal analysis is inherently more difficult than one-
dimensional signal analysis. Some important theorems in one-dimensional case cannot be
generalized to higher dimension.
For explaining further, we need to recall the statement of Paley–Wiener’s theorem
(Lemma 2.2): A bounded continuous function f : Rk ? R belongs to B(a1, . . . , ak) if and
only if it can be extended to a holomorphic function in Ck satisfying
??f
(
x1 + y1
?
?1, . . . , xk + yk
?
?1
)?? ? const · e?(a1|y1|+···+ak |yk|).

Roughly speaking, band-limited functions are the same as holomorphic functions of expo-
nential type. Therefore we can say that signal analysis is a part of complex analysis5. Then
it is easy to see why multi-dimensional case is more difficult than one-dimensional case:
Zero points of holomorphic functions in C are isolated, whereas zero points of holomor-
phic functions in Ck (k ? 2) form positive dimensional complex varieties whose geometry
are highly nontrivial in general. This causes a fundamental difference in the nature of
one-dimensional/multi-dimensional signal analysis.
More concretely speaking, we face difficulties of higher dimension in the following two
issues. (The second issue is more serious than the first one.)
(1) Interpolation: Sampling and interpolation are the most basic themes of signal
analysis. We recall a sampling theorem stated in Lemma 2.4 with a bit simplifi-
cation6: Let f ? B(1, . . . , 1) and 0 < c < 1. If f vanishes over ? def= cZk then f
is identically zero. This theorem is valid for all dimensions. The crucial point of
the statement is that we consider only regular sampling, which means that the
fundamental domain [0, c]k of the sampling set ? = cZk is similar to the frequency
domain [?1/2, 1/2]k. It is also easy to prove the following regular interpolation
theorem: If c > 1 then the map
B(1, . . . , 1) ? ??(cZk), f 7? (f(?))??cZk
is surjective.
When k = 1, Beurling [Beu89] proved that essentially the same results also hold
for irregular sampling/interpolation: Let ? ? R be a uniformly discrete set, i.e.
the infimum of |?1 ? ?2| over distinct ?1, ?2 ? ? is positive. Suppose the lower
density
lim inf
R??
inf
t?R
#(? ? [t, t+R])
R
is larger than 1. Under this setting, Beurling proved that if f ? B(1) vanishes over
? then f is identically zero. Similarly, he also proved that if ? ? R is a uniformly
discrete set and its upper density
lim sup
R??
sup
t?R
#(? ? [t, t +R])
R
is smaller than 1, then the map
B(1) ? ??(?), f 7? (f(?))???
5Of course this is over-simplified. Signal analysis is a mutli-faceted discipline and cannot be classified
as a sub-area of complex analysis. For example, we emphasized its communication theory aspect in
Subsection 1.1. But the complex analysis viewpoint is convenient here.
6Here we state a (seemingly) simpler version of the theorem for clarifying the argument, but indeed
this statement is equivalent to Lemma 2.4.
EMBEDDING PROBLEM OF Zk-ACTIONS 9
is surjective. Therefore only the lower/upper density of ? determines its sam-
pling/interpolation property.
When k ? 2, the situation is much more messy. We have no clear theorems
valid for irregular sampling and interpolation (see [OU12] for the details). For
example, consider
?1 =
{(
?2 t1,
t2
?
)???? t1, t2 ? Z
}
, ?2 =
{(
? t1,
t2
?2
)???? t1, t2 ? Z
}
(? > 0).
Suppose ? is very small. The density of ?1 is equal to 1/? (very large) and the
density of ?2 is equal to ? (very small). The function f(z1, z2) = sin(??z2) ?
B(1, 1) vanishes over ?1 but is not identically zero. Thus ?1 is not a sampling set
for functions in B(1, 1) although its density is very large. Similarly, it is also easy
to prove that ?2 is not an interpolation set for B(1, 1), namely the map
B(1, 1) ? ??(?2), f 7? (f(?))???2
is not surjective, although its density is very small.
In the proof of Main Theorem 2 we need to construct interpolating functions
for some irregular sets ? ? Rk. The paper [GT] addressed the same problem (in
dimension one) by employing Beurling’s interpolation theorem mentioned above.
But this theorem is not valid in higher dimension.
(2) Zero points of band-limited maps f : Ck ? Ck: One crucial ingredient of
the proof of Main Theorem 2 is the study of (isolated) zero points7 of some holo-
morphic maps f = (f1, . . . , fk) : C
k ? Ck all of whose entries fi are band-limited
functions. We call such a map f a band-limited map. It becomes important to
know the growth of
(1.1) {z ? Ck| z is an isolated zero point of f with |z| < R}
as R goes to infinity. If k = 1, then this is a very easy problem. It follows
from Jensen’s formula or Nevanlinna’s first main theorem ([Hay64, Section 1.3],
[NW14, Section 1.1]) that if f ? B(a) then
? R
1
#{z ? C| f(x) = 0, |z| < r}dr
r
? 2aR + constf .
In particular (1.1) grows at most linearly in R. Moreover if f ? B(a) has no zero
points, then it must be of the form
f(z) = e?z+?
for some constants ? and ?.
7A point p ? Ck is a zero point of f : Ck ? Ck if f(p) = 0. Notice that the domain and target of f
have the same dimension. Therefore generically zero points of f are expected to be isolated.
10 YONATAN GUTMAN, YIXIAO QIAO, MASAKI TSUKAMOTO
When k ? 2, the situation is radically different. First, we have no simple
description of f : Ck ? Ck having no zero points. For example, the map of the
form
f(z1, z2) = (e
?z1+?, f2(z1, z2)), (f2(z1, z2): arbitrary band-limited function),
have no zero points. Second (and more importantly), the set (1.1) may have arbi-
trarily fast growth. This inconvenient phenomena was first observed by Cornalba–
Shiffman [CS72] and known as the failure of the transcendental Bezout theorem.
Here we briefly review their construction (with minor modification). Let {?n}?n=1
be an arbitrary sequence of positive integers (say, ?n = 2
2n). We choose a poly-
nomial pn(w) (of one-variable) having ?n zeros in |w| < 1. Let ? : R ? R be a
(nonzero) rapidly decreasing function satisfying supp ?? ? [?1/2, 1/2]. We choose
?n > 0 so that the function
gn(w)
def
= ?n ?(w)pn(w)
is bounded by 2?n over R. We define f = (f1, f2) : C
2 ? C2 as follows:
f1(z1, z2) = sin(?z1), f2(z1, z2) =
??
n=1
gn(z2)
sin ?(z1 ? n)
?(z1 ? n)
.
Both f1 and f2 belong to B(1, 1). The map f has ?n zero points of the form (n, w)
(|w| < 1). Therefore
#{z ? C2| z is an isolated zero point of f and |z| < n + 1} ? ?n.
As a conclusion, it is hard (and sometimes impossible) to control the set (1.1)
in higher dimension.
The above two issues show that general theory of multi-dimensional signal analysis is
not strong enough for the proof of Main Theorem 2. Thus we have to develop tailored
methods specific for the situation of the theorem. This becomes the main technical task
of the paper. We address the issues (1) and (2) in Sections 4 and 5 respectively. The
techniques developed there seem to have some independent interests, and possibly further
applications will be found in a future.
The key ideas are as follows. (Here we ignore many details for simplicity. The real
arguments are different.)
(1)’ Almost regular interpolation: As we mentioned above, we need to con-
struct interpolation for some irregular sets ? ? Rk. But our sets ? are not
completely general uniformly discrete sets. They are “almost” regular sets in the
sense that we have a decomposition

?n are sufficiently far from each other.
such that each ?n is a part of a regular interpolation set and that the distances
between different pieces ?m and ?n are sufficiently large. See Figure 1.1. We
develop a technique of constructing interpolation for such almost regular sets. As
a conclusion, we can prove that they have (essentially) all the nice properties which
regular interpolation sets possess.
(2)’ Good/bad decomposition of the space: It is very difficult in general to
control the zero points of holomorphic maps f : Ck ? Ck. The maps f used
in the proof of Main Theorem 2 are very special, but still we cannot control all
their (isolated) zero points. Therefore we simply give up to control all the zero
points of f . Instead we decompose the space Ck into two disjoint regions:
Ck = G ? B.
In the “good region”G, the zero points of f are very sparsely distributed and we
can control them as we like. In the “bad region” B, the zero points of f may have
extremely high density, but the region B itself is very tiny. See Figure 1.2. We
consider a Voronoi diagram with respect to the zero points of f . Then most of
the space Ck is cover by very large (and hence well organized) tiles whose Voronoi
centers are zero points in G. We don’t have any control of tiles whose centers
are located in B. They may have very complicated structure. But every messy
phenomena is confined in the tiny region B and does not affect much the whole
picture.
In Subsection 3.1 we state a key proposition (Proposition 3.1) and prove Main Theorem
2 assuming it. The rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of Proposition 3.1. The
strategy of the proof is explained in Subsection 3.2. It might be better for some readers
to go to Subsections 3.1 and 3.2 before reading Section 2.

points of f are sparsely and almost regularly distributed inside the good
region G. The bad region B may contain plenty of zero points but it is tiny.
1.5. Organization of the paper. In Section 2 we review mean dimension, band-limited
functions, simplicial complexes and convex sets. In Section 3 we state the main proposition
and prove Main Theorem 2 assuming it. In particular, we give an overview of the proof
of the main theorem. In Section 4 we construct interpolating functions. In Section 5 we
construct certain “tiling-like maps” and study their properties. In Section 6 we prove the
main proposition by using the results in Sections 2, 4 and 5. In Section 7 we explain some
open problems.

2. Preliminaries
2.1. Review of mean dimension. Here we review the definition of mean dimension
[Gro99, LW00]. Throughout this paper we promise that every simplicial complex is finite
(i.e. it has only finitely many simplicies) and that for a natural number N
[N ] = {0, 1, 2, . . . , N ? 1}k.
Let (X, d) be a compact metric space and Y a topological space. Let ? be a posi-
tive number and f : X ? Y a continuous map. f is said to be an ?-embedding if
diamf?1(y) < ? for all y ? Y . We define the ?-width dimension Widim?(X, d) as the
minimum integer n such that there exist an n-dimensional simplicial complex P and an
?-embedding f : X ? P . This is a macroscopic dimension of X in the scale of ?. The
EMBEDDING PROBLEM OF Zk-ACTIONS 13
topological dimension dimX can be obtained by8
dimX = lim
??0
Widim?(X, d).
Let (X,Zk, T ) be a dynamical system, namely X is a compact metric space (with a
distance d) and T : Zk ×X ? X is a continuous action. For a finite subset ? ? Zk we
define a distance d? on X by
d?(x, y) = max
n??
d(T nx, T ny).
It is easy to check the following subadditivity and invariance:
Widim?(X, d?1??2) ? Widim?(X, d?1) +Widim?(X, d?2),
Widim?(X, da+?) = Widim?(X, d?) (a ? Zk, a+ ? = {a + x| x ? ?}).
Then by the standard division argument we can show the existence of the limit
lim
N??
Widim?
(
X, d[N ]
)
Nk
.
We define the mean dimension of (X,Zk, T ) by
mdim(X,Zk, T ) = lim
??0
(
lim
N??
Widim?
(
X, d[N ]
)
Nk
)
.
This is a topological invariant, namely it is independent of the choice of the distance d.
We usually abbreviate this to mdim(X).
2.2. Review of band-limited functions. Here we review some basic theorems on
band-limited functions. Throughout this subsection we assume that a1, . . . , ak are pos-
itive numbers. We denote by z = x + y
?
?1 the standard coordinate of Ck with
x = (x1, . . . , xk), y = (y1, . . . , yk) ? Rk.
Lemma 2.1. Let f : Ck ? C be a holomorphic function such that there exists C > 0
satisfying
??f
(
x+ y
?
?1
)?? ? Ce?(a1|y1|+···+ak |yk|). Then it follows that
??f
(
x+ y
?
?1
)?? ? ||f ||L?(Rk) e?(a1|y1|+···+ak|yk|).
Proof. The paper [GT, Lemma 2.1] proves this for f : C ? C. So we consider the
case of k > 1. Fix x + y
?
?1 ? Ck. For s + t
?
?1 ? C we set g
(
s+ t
?
?1
)
=
f
(
x+ y
(
s+ t
?
?1
))
. g is a holomorphic function satisfying
??g
(
s+ t
?
?1
)?? ? Ce?|t|(a1|y1|+···+ak|yk|).
By the statement of the one variable case,
??g
(
s+ t
?
?1
)?? is bounded by
||g||L?(R) e?|t|(a1|y1|+···+ak |yk|) ? ||f ||L?(Rk) e?|t|(a1|y1|+···+ak|yk|).
8If readers do not know the definition of topological dimension, then they may think that this is the
definition of topological dimension. Only one nontrivial point is that dimX is a topological invariant
whereas Widim?(X, d) depends on the distance d.
14 YONATAN GUTMAN, YIXIAO QIAO, MASAKI TSUKAMOTO
Letting s = 0 and t = 1, we get the statement. 
Lemma 2.2 (Paley–Wiener’s theorem). Let f : Rk ? C be a bounded continuous func-
tion. Then the following two conditions are equivalent.
(1) The Fourier transform f? is supported in
?k
i=1[?ai/2, ai/2].
(2) f can be extended to a holomorphic function in Ck such that there exists C > 0
satisfying
??f
(
x+ y
?
?1
)?? ? Ce?(a1|y1|+···+ak|yk|).
Proof. This is a special case of a distribution version of Paley–Wiener’s theorem ([Sch66,
Chapter 7, Section 8]). Here we prove it directly only by using the standard version of
Paley–Wiener’s theorem ([DM72, Section 3.3]): For a (one-variable) L2-function f : R ?
C, the above two Conditions (1) and (2) are equivalent. Set ? =
?k
i=1[?ai/2, ai/2].
First we assume that f : Rk ? C is a L2-function and prove (1) ? (2). Suppose f
satisfies (1). Then
f(x) =
?
Rk
f?(?)e2?
?
?1x·? d?1 . . . d?k =
?
?
f?(?)e2?
?
?1x·? d?1 . . . d?k.
We extend f to a holomorphic function in Ck by
f
(
x+ y
?
?1
)
=
?
?
f?(?)e2?
?
?1(x+y
?
?1)·? d?1 . . . d?k.
Then we can check Condition (2):
??f
(
x+ y
?
?1
)?? ?
?
?
|f?(?)|e?2?y·? d?1 . . . d?k ? const · e?(a1|y1|+···+ak|yk|).
Next suppose f satisfies (2). Fix ? ? Rk and suppose |?1| > a1/2. We will show
f?(?) = 0. We fix x2, . . . , xk and consider f(x1, . . . , xk) as a one-variable function of
variable x1. This is a L
2-function (of variable x1) for almost every choice of (x2, . . . , xk).
It follows from
??f
(
x1 + y1
?
?1, x2, . . . , xk
)?? ? const · e?a1|y1| and the standard Paley–
Wiener’s theorem that
? ?
??
f(x1, x2, . . . , xk)e
?2?
?
?1x1?1 dx1 = 0 for a.e. (x2, . . . , xk).
Therefore
f?(?) =
?
Rk?1
(? ?
??
f(x1, x2, . . . , xk)e
?2?
?
?1x1?1 dx1
)
e?2?
?
?1(x2?2+···+xk?k) dx2 . . . dxk = 0.
Thus the proof has been completed under the assumption f ? L2.
Next we only assume that f : Rk ? C is a bounded continuous function. We choose
a rapidly decreasing function ? : Rk ? R such that maxx?Rk |?(x)| = ?(0) = 1 and
supp ?? ? (?1/2, 1/2)k. We set ??(x) = ?(?x) for ? > 0. It satisfies ???(?) = ??k??(?/?)
and hence supp ??? ? (??/2, ?/2)k. ?? converges to 1 uniformly over every compact subset
EMBEDDING PROBLEM OF Zk-ACTIONS 15
of Rk as ? ? 0. Since ?? is rapidly decreasing (and hence in L2), we can extend it to a
holomorphic function satisfying
(2.1)
????
(
x+ y
?
?1
)?? ? e??(|y1|+···+|yk|) (here we used Lemma 2.1).
We set f?(x) = ??(x)f(x). Then f? is a L
2-function and satisfies |f?(x)| ? |f(x)|.
Suppose f satisfies (1). Then f?? is supported in
?k
i=1[?(ai + ?)/2, (ai + ?)/2]. Thus by
the previous argument for L2-functions and Lemma 2.1, we can extend f? to a holomorphic
function satisfying
??f?
(
x+ y
?
?1
)?? ? ||f?||L?(Rk) e?{(a1+?)|y1|+···+(ak+?)|yk|}
? ||f ||L?(Rk) e?{(a1+?)|y1|+···+(ak+?)|yk|}.
(2.2)
Then we can extend f to a meromorphic function in Ck by
f
(
x+ y
?
?1
)
=
f?
(
x+ y
?
?1
)
??
(
x+ y
?
?1
) .
This is independent of ? > 0 because of the unique continuation. Since ?? converges to
1 uniformly over every compact subset, f
(
x+ y
?
?1
)
is actually a holomorphic function
(namely it does not have neither poles nor indeterminacy points). By taking the limit in
(2.2) we get ??f
(
x+ y
?
?1
)?? ? ||f ||L?(Rk) e?(a1|y1|+···+ak|yk|).
Next suppose f satisfies (2). By (2.1) and Lemma 2.1, we get (2.2) again. Since f? ? L2,
the Fourier transform f?? is supported in
?k
i=1[?(ai + ?)/2, (ai + ?)/2]. The functions f??
converge to f? in the topology of distribution. Thus f? is supported in
?k
i=1[?ai/2, ai/2].

Corollary 2.3. The space B1(a1, . . . , ak) of continuous functions f : Rk ? [?1, 1] band-
limited in
?k
i=1[?ai/2, ai/2] is compact with respect to the topology of uniform convergence
over compact subsets of Rk.
Proof. Let {fn}?n=1 be a sequence in B1(a1, . . . , ak). By Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 the functions
fn can be holomorphically extended over C
k satisfying |fn(z)| ? e?(a1|y1|+···+ak |yk|). In
particular {fn} is bounded over every compact subset of Ck. By the Cauchy integration
formula, it becomes an equicontinuous family over every compact subset (i.e. normal
family). So we can choose a converging subsequence by the Arzela–Ascoli theorem. 
Lemma 2.4 (Sampling theorem). Let f : Rk ? R be a bounded continuous function
band-limited in
?k
i=1[?ai/2, ai/2]. Suppose that there exist positive numbers b1, . . . , bk
such that aibi < 1 for all 1 ? i ? k and that f vanishes over
{(b1n1, . . . , bknk)|n1, . . . , nk ? Z}.
Then f is identically zero.
16 YONATAN GUTMAN, YIXIAO QIAO, MASAKI TSUKAMOTO
Proof. As in the proof of Lemma 2.2, it is enough to prove the statement under the assump-
tion that f is a L2-function. Then the proof is standard as follows. Set g(x1, . . . , xk) =
f(b1x1, . . . , bkxk). This vanishes on Z
k.
g?(?) =
1
b1 . . . bk
f?
(

.
Then g? is supported in

Consider the Fourier series of g?(?) for ? ? (?1/2, 1/2)k:
g?(?) =

The coefficients an are given by

e2?
?
?1n·?g?(?)d?1 . . . d?k = F (F(g)) (n) = g(n) = 0.
Thus g? = 0. This implies g = 0 and f = 0. 
2.3. Technical results on simplicial complexes. The results of this subsection are
used only in Section 6. So readers can postpone reading this subsection until they come
to Section 6. Recall that we promised that every simplicial complex is finite. (This is
mainly for the simplicity of the exposition.) Let P be a simplicial complex. A map
f : P ? Rn is said to be simplicial if it has the form
f
(
m?
k=0
?kvk
)
=
m?
k=0
?kf(vk),
(
?k ? 0,

)
,
on every simplex ? ? P , where v0, . . . , vm are the vertices of ?. We define ||x||? =
max1?i?n |xi| for x = (x1, . . . , xn) ? Rn.
Lemma 2.5 (Approximation lemma). Let ? and ? be positive numbers. Let (X, d) be a
compact metric space and P a simplicial complex. Let ? : X ? P be an ?-embedding and
f : X ? Rn a continuous map satisfying
d(x, y) < ? =? ||f(x)? f(y)||? < ?.
Then, after taking a sufficiently fine subdivision of P , we can find a simplicial map g :
P ? Rn satisfying
||f(x)? g(?(x))||? < ? (?x ? X).
Proof. We reproduce the proofs in [GLT16, GT] for the completeness. By subdividing P
we can assume that for every vertex v ? P the diameter of ??1(O(v)) is smaller than ?,
where O(v) is the open star of v, i.e. the union of the relative interiors of all simplices
containing v. For each vertex v ? P we choose g(v) ? f(??1(O(v))). (If this is empty,
EMBEDDING PROBLEM OF Zk-ACTIONS 17
then we choose arbitrary g(v).) We linearly extend g all over P . Take x ? X and let
? ? P be the simplex containing ?(x) in its relative interior. Every vertex v ? ? satisfies
?(x) ? O(v) and hence ||f(x)? g(v)|? < ? because the diameter of f(??1(O(v))) (which
contains both f(x) and g(v)) is smaller than ?. g(?(x)) is a convex combination of such
g(v). Hence ||f(x)? g(?(x))||? < ?. 
Let P be a simplicial complex. We denote by V the set of all vertices of P . The
set Hom(P,Rn) of simplicial maps f : P ? Rn can be identified with (Rn)V , which is
endowed with the natural topology.
Lemma 2.6 (Embedding lemma). (1) If dimP < n/2 then the set of simplicial em-
beddings (i.e. injective simplicial maps) f : P ? Rn is an open dense subset of
Hom(P,Rn).
(2) Let U be the set of simplicial maps f : P ? Rn such that, for every subcomplex
Q ? P and every subset A ? {1, 2, . . . , n} with #A > 2 dimQ, the map
Q? RA, x 7? f(x)|A
is an embedding. Then U is open and dense in Hom(P,Rn).
Proof. The statement (2) follows from (1) because the natural map (restriction)
Hom(P,Rn) ? Hom(Q,RA)
is an open map and thus the preimage of an open and dense set under this map is also open
and dense. (Notice that it corresponds to the natural projection (Rn)V (P ) ? (RA)V (Q)
where V (P ) and V (Q) are the sets of vertices of P and Q.) Thus it is enough to prove (1).
First we show that simplicial embeddings f : P ? Rn form an open set. Let f : P ? Rn
be a simplicial embedding. We would like to show that “injectiveness” is preserved under
a small perturbation of f .
• Let ? ? P be a simplex with the vertices v0, . . . , vm. Then f |? : ? ? Rn is an
injection, which means that f(v0), . . . , f(vm) are affinely independent. If g : P ?
Rn is sufficiently close to f then g(v0), . . . , g(vm) are also affinely independent.
• Let ?1,?2 ? P be two disjoint simplices. Then the distance between f(?1) and
f(?2) is positive. This condition is certainly preserved under a small perturbation.
• Let ?1,?2 ? P be two simplices which share a nonempty simplex ?1 ? ?2. We
assume ?1 6= ?1 ? ?2 and ?2 6= ?1 ? ?2. Consider V (?1) \ V (?1 ? ?2) and
V (?2) \ V (?1 ? ?2), and denote their convex hulls by ??1 and ??2 respectively.
Fix v ? V (?1 ??2). The map f |?1??2 : ?1 ??2 ? Rn is injective, which means
the positivity of
min {Angle between the vectors f(???vw1) and f(???vw2)|w1 ? ??1, w2 ? ??2} .
This condition is preserved under a small perturbation.
18 YONATAN GUTMAN, YIXIAO QIAO, MASAKI TSUKAMOTO
The above proves that sufficiently small perturbations of f are also injective.
Next we prove that simplicial embeddings f : P ? Rn form a dense set. Let f : P ? Rn
be an arbitrary simplicial map and U ? Hom(P,Rn) an open neighborhood of f . By
simple linear algebra we can choose g ? U such that for any subset {v1, . . . , vm} ? V (P )
with m ? n+ 1 the points g(v1), . . . , g(vm) are affinely independent. As 2 dimP + 1 ? n,
g|?1??2 is an embedding for any two simplices ?1,?2 ? P and thus g is an embedding. 
How to use Lemmas 2.5 and 2.6: We would like to illustrate the above two lemmas by
a simple application. (This is a prototype of the later argument but logically independent
of the proof of the main theorems. So experienced readers can skip it.) Let (X, d) be a
compact metric space. We prove a classical result in the dimension theory: If dimX < n/2
then X can be topologically embedded into Rn. The set of all embeddings f : X ? Rn is
equal to
(2.3)
??
m=1
{f : X ? Rn| (1/m)-embedding}.
So it is a G?-subset of the space of all continuous maps f : X ? Rn since “(1/m)-
embedding” is an open condition. Fix a natural number m and a positive number ?. Let
f : X ? Rn be an arbitrary continuous map. Choose 0 < ? < 1/m so that
d(x, y) < ? =? ||f(x)? f(y)||? < ?.
By dimX = lim??0Widim?(X, d), we can find a simplicial complex P of dimP ? dimX <
n/2 and an ?-embedding ? : X ? P . By Lemma 2.5 there exists a simplicial map
g : P ? Rn satisfying ||f(x)? g(?(x))||? < ? for all x ? X . By dimP < n/2 and Lemma
2.6 (1) we can find a simplicial embedding h : P ? Rn satisfying ||g(p)? h(p)||? < ? for
all p ? P . Then the map h?? : X ? Rn is an ?-embedding (and hence (1/m)-embedding
by ? < 1/m) and satisfies ||f(x)? h ? ?(x)||? < 2? for all x ? X . Since ? is arbitrary, this
shows that
{f : X ? Rn| (1/m)-embedding}
is dense in the space of all continuous maps from X to Rn. Thus, by the Baire Category
Theorem, the set (2.3) is dense G?. In particular there exists a topological embedding of
X into Rn.
2.4. A lemma on convex sets. The result of this subsection is used only in Section 6.
Let r > 0 and W ? Rk. We define ?rW as the set of all t ? Rk such that the closed
r-ball Br(t) around t have non-empty intersections both with W and R
k \W . We set
IntrW =W \ ?rW .
Lemma 2.7. For any c > 1 and r > 0 there exists R > 0 such that if a bounded closed
convex subset W ? Rk satisfies IntRW 6= ? then
|W ? ?rW | < c |IntrW | .
EMBEDDING PROBLEM OF Zk-ACTIONS 19
Here | · | denotes the k-dimensional volume (Lebesgue measure).
Proof. We can assume 0 ? IntRW . For a > 0 we set aW = {at| t ? W}.
Claim 2.8. ?rW ?
(
1 + r
R
)
W .
Proof. Take u ? Rk outside of
(
1 + r
R
)
W . There exists a hyperplane H = {a1x1 + · · ·+
akxk = 1} ? Rk separating u and
(
1 + r
R
)
W . Namely
u ? {a1x1 + · · ·+ akxk > 1},
(
1 +
r
R
)
W ? {a1x1 + · · ·+ akxk < 1}.
Then
W ?
{
a1x1 + · · ·+ akxk <
(
1 +
r
R
)?1}
.
It follows that the distance between u and W is greater than the distance between H and(
1 + r
R
)?1
H . Let h be the distance between
(
1 + r
R
)?1
H and the origin. h > R since
0 ? IntRW . Then the distance between H and
(
1 + r
R
)?1
H is
(
1 +
r
R
)
h? h = rh
R
> r.
This implies that u does not belong to ?rW . 
Claim 2.9. ?rW ?
(
1? r
R
)
W = ? and hence IntrW ?
(
1? r
R
)
W .
Proof. Almost the same argument shows that if we take a point u outside of W then
the distance between u and
(
1? r
R
)
W is greater than r. This implies that every point
v ?
(
1? r
R
)
W satisfies Br(v) ?W and hence does not belong to ?rW . 
It follows from these two claims that
|W ? ?rW | ?

|W |,

Thus
|W ? ?rW | ?

|IntrW | .
Since c > 1, if r/R is sufficiently small then the right-hand side is smaller than c |IntrW |.

3. Main proposition
3.1. Statement of the main proposition. Main Theorem 2 in Subsection 1.3 follows
from the next proposition whose proof occupies the rest of the paper.
20 YONATAN GUTMAN, YIXIAO QIAO, MASAKI TSUKAMOTO
Proposition 3.1 (Main Proposition). Let a1, . . . , ak and ? be positive numbers. Let
(X,Zk, T ) be a dynamical system and d a distance on X. Let f : X ? B1(a1, . . . , ak) be
a Zk-equivariant continuous map. If X has the marker property and satisfies
mdim(X) <
a1 . . . ak
2
then there exists a Zk-equivariant continuous map g : X ? B1(a1 + ?, . . . , ak + ?) such
that
• ||f(x)? g(x)||L?(Rk) < ? for all x ? X.
• g is a ?-embedding with respect to the distance d.
It is important to note that the map g takes values in B1(a1 + ?, . . . , ak + ?) which is
slightly larger than the target B1(a1, . . . , ak) of the original map f . Here we prove that
Proposition 3.1 implies Main Theorem 2.
Proof of Main Theorem 2, assuming Proposition 3.1. The proof is very close to the stan-
dard proof of the Baire Category Theorem. We assume diam(X, d) < 1 by rescaling the
distance (just for simplicity of the notation). For 1 ? i ? k we choose sequences {ain}?n=1
such that
0 < ai1 < ai2 < ai3 < · · · < ai, mdim(X) <
a1na2n . . . akn
2
(?n ? 1).
For n ? 1 we inductively define a positive number ?n and a Zk-equivariant (1/n)-
embedding (with respect to d) fn : X ? B1(a1n, . . . , akn). First we set
?1 = 1, f1(x) = 0 (?x ? X).
Notice that f1 is a 1-embedding because diam(X, d) < 1. Suppose we have defined ?n
and fn. Since fn is a (1/n)-embedding, we can choose 0 < ?n+1 < ?n/2 such that if a
Zk-equivariant continuous map g : X ? B1(a1, . . . , ak) satisfies
sup
x?X
||fn(x)? g(x)||L?(Rk) ? ?n+1
then g is also a (1/n)-embedding. By applying Proposition 3.1 to fn, we can find a
Zk-equivariant continuous map fn+1 : X ? B1(a1,n+1, . . . , ak,n+1) such that
• supx?X ||fn(x)? fn+1(x)||L?(Rk) < ?n+1/2.
• fn+1 is a 1n+1-embedding with respect to d.

Here we used ?l+1 < ?l/2. By taking a limit, we find a Z
k-equivariant continuous map
f : X ? B1(a1, . . . , ak) satisfying
sup
x?X
||f(x)? fn(x)||L?(Rk) ? ?n+1
for all n ? 1. It follows from the definition of ?n+1 that f is a (1/n)-embedding. Since n
is arbitrary, f is an embedding. 
The above proof used a flexibility exhibited by band-limited signals and not by discrete
signals. At each step of the induction, the target B1(a1,n+1, . . . , ak,n+1) of the map fn+1
is slightly bigger than the previous target B1(a1n, . . . , akn). The differences ai,n+1 ? ain
converge to zero as n goes to infinity. Such an argument is possible because a1, . . . , ak
are continuous parameters. We cannot apply the same argument to
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
because
it depends on a discrete parameter D.
3.2. Strategy of the proof. Most known theorems about embedding (e.g. the Whitney
embedding theorem for manifolds) are proved by perturbation. The proof of Proposition
3.1 also uses this idea but with a twist. The map g in the statement of Proposition 3.1
will have the form
g(x) = g1(x) + g2(x), (x ? X).
The first term g1(x) is a band-limited function in B1(a1, . . . , ak), which is constructed by
perturbing the function f(x) ? B1(a1, . . . , ak). The second term g2(x) is also a band-
limited function whose frequencies are restricted in a compact subset of

?ai + ?

,

]
\
k?

.
The construction of g2(x) is (essentially) independent of f(x). The function g2(x) encodes
how to perturb f(x). In other words, the function g1(x) is constructed by perturbing
the function f(x), and the perturbation method is determined by the function g2(x).
Probably this explanation is not very clear. So let us try a more naive explanation.
Consider cooking. Each point x ? X is a cook. The function f(x) is an ingredient of
cooking (e.g. a raw salmon) that the cook x chooses. The function g2(x) is a cookware
(e.g. kitchen knife and oven) that the cook x possesses. The function g1(x) is the result
22 YONATAN GUTMAN, YIXIAO QIAO, MASAKI TSUKAMOTO
of cooking (e.g. grilled salmon). The grilled salmon g1(x) is made from the raw salmon
f(x) by using the knife and oven g2(x). The knife and oven g2(x) are independent of the
raw salmon f(x).
The Fourier transforms F (g1(x)) and F (g2(x)) have disjoint supports. Hence if we
have the equation g(x) = g(y) for some x and y in X , then it follows that
g1(x) = g1(y), g2(x) = g2(y).
We would like to deduce d(x, y) < ? from these equations. In other words we try to
determine who is the cook (up to some small error) by knowing the result of cooking
(g1(x) = g1(y)) and what cookware was used (g2(x) = g2(y)).
More precisely, the proof goes as follows. Take x ? X . The function f(x) is defined
over Rk. It is difficult to control functions over unbounded domains. So we introduce a
tiling (indexed by Zk)
Rk =
?
n?Zk
W (x, n),
such that
(1) Each tileW (x, n) is a bounded convex set, and different tilesW (x, n) andW (x,m)
are disjoint except for their boundaries.
(2) W (x, n) depends continuously on x ? X in the Hausdorff topology.
(3) The tiles are equivariant in the sense that
W (T nx,m) = ?n +W (x, n+m) = {?n + t| t ? W (x, n+m)}.
(4) “Most” part of the space Rk is covered by “sufficiently large” tiles.
We try to perturb the function f(x) over each tile W (x, n). We can construct a good
perturbation over sufficiently large tiles. So if every tile is sufficiently large, then we
can construct a good perturbation of f(x) over the whole space Rk. Unfortunately some
tiles may be small in general. We cannot construct a good perturbation over such tiny
tiles. Condition (4) helps us here. We will construct a “social welfare system” of the
tiles W (x, n). (This idea was first introduced in [GT].) Large tiles help small tiles and
bear “additional” perturbations which are originally “duties” of small tiles. By using this
social welfare system we construct the perturbation g1(x) of the function f(x).
The map g1 will have the following property: If x and y in X satisfy g1(x) = g1(y) and
(3.1) ?n ? Zk : W (x, n) = W (y, n)
then it follows that d(x, y) < ?. Namely if we know g1(x) and the tiling {W (x, n)} then
we can recover the point x up to error ?. So the next problem is how to encode the
information of the tiles. The function g2(x) is introduced for solving this problem. We
encode all the information of the tiles W (x, n) to a band-limited function g2(x). (Indeed
the real argument below goes in a reverse way. First we construct the function g2(x), and
then the tiles W (x, n) are constructed from g2(x). So g2(x) knows everything about the
EMBEDDING PROBLEM OF Zk-ACTIONS 23
tiles W (x, n).) In particular the equation g2(x) = g2(y) implies (3.1). As a conclusion,
the function g(x) = g1(x) + g2(x) satisfies the requirements of Proposition 3.1. This is
the outline of the proof.
We would like to emphasize that the most important new idea introduced in this paper
is the technique to encode the information of the tiling {W (x, n)} into the band-limited
function g2(x). This idea is new even in the one dimensional case. This is the main reason
why Main Theorems 1 and 2 have some novelty even in the case of k = 1.
Section 4 introduces interpolating functions which will be used in the perturbation
process. In Section 5 we construct the tiling W (x, n) and their social welfare system and
explain how to encode them into a band-limited function. The proof of Proposition 3.1
is finished in Section 6.
3.3. Fixing some notations. The proof of Proposition 3.1 is notationally messy. So
here we gather some of the notations for the convenience of readers. Throughout the rest
of the paper (except for Section 7 where we discuss open problems) we fix the following.
• a1, . . . , ak and ? are positive numbers. We additionally assume
(3.2) ? < min(1, a1, . . . , ak).
• (X,Zk, T ) is a dynamical system satisfying the marker property and
mdim(X) <
a1 . . . ak
2
.
• We fix positive rational numbers ?1, . . . , ?k satisfying
(3.3) ?i < ai (?1 ? i ? k), mdim(X) <
?1 . . . ?k
2
.
• We define a lattice ? ? Rk by
(3.4) ? =
{(
t1
?1
, . . . ,
tk
?k
)???? t1, . . . , tk ? Z
}
.
Moreover we define ?1 ? Rk by
(3.5) ?1 =
?
n?Zk
(n+ ?), (n+ ? = {n+ ?| ? ? ?}).
Since ?i are rational numbers, ?1 is also a lattice.
4. Interpolating functions
Recall that we fixed positive numbers a1, . . . , ak, positive rational numbers ?1, . . . , ?k
with ?i < ai and lattices ? ? ?1 ? Rk in Subsection 3.3. We fix a positive number ?
satisfying
(4.1) ?1 ? i ? k : ?i + ? < ai.
24 YONATAN GUTMAN, YIXIAO QIAO, MASAKI TSUKAMOTO
For r > 0 and a ? Rk we denote by Br(a) the closed r-ball around a, and we set
Br = Br(0). We choose a rapidly decreasing function ?0 : R
k ? R satisfying ?0(0) = 1
and suppF(?0) ? B?/2.
Notation 4.1. (1) We set
(4.2) K0 = sup
t?Rk
?
???1
|?0(t? ?)|.
This is finite because ?0 is rapidly decreasing and ?1 is a lattice.
(2) We fix r0 > 0 satisfying
(4.3)
?
???1\Br0
|?0(?)| <

2
.
Definition 4.2. (1) A subset ? ? ?1 is called an admissible set if any two points
?1, ?2 ? ? satisfy at least one of the following two conditions:
• ?1 ? ?2 ? ?.
• |?1 ? ?2| > r0.
This notion is an elaborated formulation of “almost regular interpolation set”
introduced in Subsection 1.4. We denote by Ads the set of all admissible sets
? ? ?1.
(2) A function p : ?1 ? [0, 1] is called an admissible function if the set
{? ? ?1| p(?) > 0}
is an admissible set. We denote by Adf the set of all admissible functions.
We define the function sinc : R ? R by
sinc(t) =
sin(?t)
?t
, sinc(0) = 1.
This is one of the most famous functions in signal analysis. The function sinc(t) vanishes
on Z \ {0} and its Fourier transform is supported in [?1/2, 1/2]. It satisfies |sinc(t)| ? 1
for all t ? R.
Let ? ? ?1 be an admissible set. We denote by ??(?) the Banach space of all bounded
functions u : ? ? R endowed with the supremum norm ||·||?. For u ? ??(?) we define a
band-limited function ??(u) ? B(?1 + ?, . . . , ?k + ?) by
??(u)(t) =
?
?=(?1,...,?k)??
u(?)?0(t? ?)
k?
i=1
sinc (?i(ti ? ?i)) , (t = (t1, . . . , tk) ? Rk).
Here ?i are rational numbers introduced in Subsection 3.3. It follows from the definition
of K0 that
||??(u)||L?(Rk) ? K0 ||u||? .
EMBEDDING PROBLEM OF Zk-ACTIONS 25
Since we promised ?i + ? < ai in (4.1), the function ??(u) belongs to B(a1, . . . , ak). We
define a bounded linear operator S? : ?
?(?) ? ??(?) by
S?(u) = ??(u)|?
(
= (??(u)(?))???
)
.
Remark 4.3. When ? is the empty set, we define ??(?) to be the trivial vector space
consisting only of zero and ??(0) = 0, the operator S? the identity operator of the trivial
vector space.
Lemma 4.4. ||S? ? id|| ? 1/2, where the left-hand side is the operator norm of S? ? id.
Proof. For ? = (?1, . . . , ?k) ? ? the function
?0(t? ?)
k?
i=1
sinc (?i(ti ? ?i))
vanishes on (?+ ?) \ {?} and its value at t = ? is 1. Then by the admissibility of ?
??(u)(?)? u(?) =
?
????\Br0 (?)
u(??)?0(?
? ? ?)
k?
i=1
sinc (?i(?
?

By the choice of r0 in (4.3),
|??(u)(?)? u(?)| ?
?
?
?
????\Br0 (?)
|?0(?? ? ?)|
?

||u||? .

Therefore the operator S? has the inverse
S?1? =
??
n=0
(id? S?)n with
????S?1?
???? ? 2.
For u ? ??(?) we define a band-limited function ??(u) ? B(a1, . . . , ak) by
??(u) = ??(S
?1
? (u)).
This function satisfies
??(u)(?) = u(?) (?? ? ?), ||??(u)||L?(Rk) ? 2K0 ||u||? .
The former property means that ??(u) interpolates the sequence u. The construction
of ??(u) is “Z
k-equivariant”: For n ? Zk and u ? ??(?) we define v ? ??(n + ?) by
v(n+ ?) = u(?). Then
?n+?(v)(t+ n) = ??(u)(t).
If ? is the empty set, then ??(0) = 0.
We denote by B1 (?
?(?)) the closed unit ball of ??(?) around the origin with respect
to the supremum norm. The function ??(u) depends continuously on ? and u as follows:
26 YONATAN GUTMAN, YIXIAO QIAO, MASAKI TSUKAMOTO
Lemma 4.5 (Continuity of the construction of ??(u)). For any r > 0 and ? > 0 there
exist r? > 0 and ?? > 0 so that if ?1,?2 ? Ads, u1 ? B1 (??(?1)) and u2 ? B1 (??(?2))
satisfy
(4.4) ?1 ? Br? = ?2 ?Br? , |u1(?)? u2(?)| < ?? (?? ? ?1 ?Br?)
then for all t ? Br
|??1(u1)(t)? ??2(u2)(t)| < ?.
Proof. By the linearity of ??,
??(u) = ??(S
?1
? (u)) =
??
n=0
?? ((id? S?)nu) .
By Lemma 4.4
||?? ((id? S?)nu)||L?(Rk) ? K0 ||(id? S?)nu||? ?
K0

||u||? .
Therefore the statement follows from the next claim.
Claim 4.6. (1) For any r > 0 and ? > 0 there exist r? > 0 and ?? > 0 so that if
?1,?2 ? Ads, u1 ? B1 (??(?1)) and u2 ? B1 (??(?2)) satisfy (4.4) then for all
t ? Br
|??1(u1)(t)? ??2(u2)(t)| < ?.
(2) For any r > 0, ? > 0 and a natural number n there exist r? > r and ?? > 0 so that
if ?1,?2 ? Ads, u1 ? B1 (??(?1)) and u2 ? B1 (??(?2)) satisfy (4.4) then for all
? ? ?1 ?Br
|(id? S?1)n(u1)(?)? (id? S?2)n(u2)(?)| < ?.
Proof. (1) We choose r? > r so large that for all t ? Br
?
???1\Br?
|?0(t? ?)| <
?
4
.
Then Condition (4.4) implies that for t ? Br
|??1(u1)(t)? ??2(u2)(t)| <

?
???1?Br?
|u1(?)? u2(?)| · |?0(t? ?)|

???1?Br?
|?0(t? ?)|.
We can choose ?? > 0 so small that the right-hand side is smaller than ?.
(2) The statement can be reduced to the case of n = 1 by induction. The case of n = 1
immediately follows from the statement (1). 

EMBEDDING PROBLEM OF Zk-ACTIONS 27
??(u) is a nice interpolating function. But we need one more twist. We naturally
identify the set {0, 1}?1 with the set of all subsets of ?1. Namely, ? ? ?1 is identified with
the characteristic function 1? ? {0, 1}?1. Then in particular Ads (the set of admissible
sets) is a Borel subset of {0, 1}?1. Let p : ?1 ? [0, 1] be an admissible function, namely
{? ? ?1| p(?) > 0} belongs to Ads. We define a probability measure µp on {0, 1}?1 by
µp =
?
???1
((1? p(?)) ?0 + p(?)?1) ,
where ?0 and ?1 are the delta probability measures at 0 and 1 on {0, 1} respectively. Since
p is admissible, the set Ads has full measure: µp(Ads) = 1.
Let ??(?1) be the Banach space of bound functions u : ?1 ? R. For u ? ??(?1) we
define a band-limited function ?(p, u) ? B(a1, . . . , ak) by
(4.5) ?(p, u) =
?
??Ads
??(u|?) dµp(?).
This function is the main product of this section.
Lemma 4.7 (Basic properties of ?). ? satisfies:
(1) Interpolation: If ? ? ?1 satisfies p(?) = 1 then ?(p, u)(?) = u(?).
(2) Boundedness: ||?(p, u)||L?(Rk) ? 2K0 ||u||?.
(3) Equivariance: For n ? Zk we define q ? Adf and v ? ??(?1) by q(?+n) = p(?)
and v(?+ n) = u(?) for ? ? ?1. Then ?(q, v)(t+ n) = ?(p, u)(t).
Proof. These three properties immediately follow from the corresponding properties of
??(u). 
We would like to show that the map ? depends continuously on p and u (Proposition
4.9 below). But we need a preparation before that. For r > 0 and p ? Adf we define
probability measures µp,r and ?p,r on {0, 1}?1?Br and {0, 1}?1\Br respectively by
µp,r =
?
???1?Br
((1? p(?)) ?0 + p(?)?1) , ?p,r =
?
???1\Br
((1? p(?)) ?0 + p(?)?1) .
It follows µp = µp,r ? ?p,r.
Lemma 4.8 (Truncation of the integral). For any r > 0 and ? > 0 if we choose r? > 0
sufficiently large then for any p ? Adf, u ? B1 (??(?1)) and t ? Br
(4.6)
?????(p, u)(t)?
?
??Ads?{0,1}?1?Br?
??(u|?)(t) dµp,r?(?)
???? < ?.
Proof. For an admissible set ?1 ? ?1 ? Br? we define Ads(?1, r?) ? Ads as the set of
?2 ? ?1 \ Br? satisfying ?1 ? ?2 ? Ads. If µp,r? ({?1}) > 0 then Ads(?1, r?) has full
measure with respect to ?p,r? because µp (Ads) = 1.
28 YONATAN GUTMAN, YIXIAO QIAO, MASAKI TSUKAMOTO

If r? is sufficiently large, then it follows from Lemma 4.5 that
|??1??2(u|?1??2)? ??1(u|?1)| < ? on Br.
Then (4.6) follows. 
Proposition 4.9 (Continuity of ?). For any r > 0 and ? > 0 there exist r? > 0 and
?? > 0 so that if p, q ? Adf and u, v ? B1 (??(?1)) satisfy
(4.7) ?? ? ?1 ? Br? : |p(?)? q(?)| < ??, |u(?)? v(?)| < ??
then for all t ? Br
|?(p, u)(t)??(q, v)(t)| < ?.
Proof. From Lemma 4.8 it is enough to show that if Condition (4.7) holds for sufficiently

The first term can be made arbitrarily small by Lemma 4.5. The second term is bounded
by

d|µp,r? ? µq,r?|.
The integral here is the total variation of the signed measure µp,r? ? µq,r?, which is equal

This can be made arbitrarily small by choosing ?? > 0 in (4.7) sufficiently small. 

5. Dynamical construction of tiling-like band-limited maps
This section is the longest section of the paper. As we described in Subsection 3.2, the
proof of Proposition 3.1 uses a tiling Rk =
?
n?Zk W (x, n) and a social welfare system
among tiles, which should be encoded into a certain band-limited function g2(x). The
purpose of this section is to construct these ingredients. The following diagram outlines
the construction.

A tiling-like band-limited map ?(x) : Ck ? Ck,
which is equivalent to a band-limited function g2(x).??y
A tiling Rk =
?
n?Zk W (x, n).??y
Weight functions w(x, n) ? [0, 1]Zk for n ? Zk,
which form a social welfare system among tiles W (x, n).
Take x ? X . First we construct a tiling Rk = ?n?Zk W0(x, n) from the point x.
We use the marker property assumption only here. This tiling is not used directly in
the proof of Proposition 3.1. Instead we construct a certain holomorphic map ?(x) :
Ck ? Ck called a “tiling-like band-limited map” from the tiles W0(x, n). Write ?(x) =
(?(x)1, . . . ,?(x)k). The Fourier transforms of ?(x)1|Rk , . . . ,?(x)k|Rk and their complex
conjugates are adjusted to have disjoint supports. Then the band-limited function
g2(x)
def
=
k?

Re (?(x)i)
becomes “equivalent” to ?(x). Namely if g2(x) = g2(y) for some x, y ? X then ?(x) =
?(y). (Indeed we will define g2(x) in Section 6 by multiplying a small constant to the
above function so that the norm of g2(x) becomes sufficiently small.)
Let us give some more heuristics concerning the construction of ?(x). Consider the
function
??L = (sin
?z1
L
, · · · , sin ?zk
L
) : Rk ? Rk
for some positive integer L thought to be very big. Every entry sin(?zi/L) of the map
??L vanishes on LZ
k ? Rk and belongs to B( 1
L
, · · · , 1
L
). Suppose we are given a family of
30 YONATAN GUTMAN, YIXIAO QIAO, MASAKI TSUKAMOTO
tilings W0(x) = {W0(x, n)}n?Zk of Rk depending continuously9 and Zk-equivariantly (i.e.
W0(T
nx,m) = ?n +W0(x, n +m)) on x ? X . We would like to replace this family of
tilings by a family of Voronoi tilings10 generated by the zeros of a continuous function
F : X × Rk ? Rk, where F has the following properties:
(1) Band-limited: Every entry of F (x, ·) belongs to B( 1
L
, · · · , 1
L
).
(2) Equivariance: F (T nx, z) = F (x, z + n) for any x ? X , z ? Rk and n ? Zk.
A candidate for F is the following function
X × Rk ? Rk, (x, t) 7?
?
n?Zk
??L(t? n) 1W0(x,n)(t).
This function is equivariant but unfortunately not continuous. However a small change
(for details see Subsection 5.2) makes it band-limited (and continuous).
Figure 5.1. The original tiling W0(x, n): ——; The zeros of F in the
“deep” interior of “big” tiles: •; “Regular” part of the new tiling W (x, n):
- - - - -.
The most simple way of generating Voronoi tilings would be to use the zeros of F (x, ·)
as generating sets for the Voronoi tiling, i.e. W (x) = Voronoi
(
zeros of F (x, ·)
)
. However,
the zeros of band-limited maps behave rather wildly in general, e.g. they are not isolated
and form a positive dimensional variety in general. We will thus instead adopt a more
9More precisely, for ? > 0 and for each x ? X and n ? Zk with IntW0(x, n) 6= ?, if y ? X is sufficiently
close to x, then the Hausdorff distance between W0(x, n) and W0(y, n) is smaller than ?.

closest distance to points in A. For more details, see Subsection 5.3.

elaborate scheme. We give a weight v(x, n) ? [0, 1] to every x ? X and n ? Zk, which
is constructed from (some appropriate) zeros of F (x, ·) in a neighborhood of n. We
use these weights to generate a family of indexed Voronoi tilings {W (x, n)}n?Zk . The
exact procedure is described in Subsection 5.4. For big tiles and big L > 0 the picture
schematically looks like Figure 5.1.
The new tiling is used in the proof of Proposition 3.1 in Section 6. We construct a
certain “weight function” (not to be confused with v(x, n) of the previous paragraph)
w(x) = (w(x, n))n?Zk ?
(
[0, 1]Z

from the tiles W (x, n). This will play a role of a social welfare system among the tiles
W (x, n). The tiles W (x, n) and functions w(x, n) are constructed from ?(x). So all their
informations are encoded into ?(x), which is equivalent to the band-limited function
g2(x).
Subsection 5.1 is a function-theoretic preparation for the construction of tiling-like
band-limited maps. Subsection 5.2 constructs a tiling-like band-limited map from a tiling
of Rk (not necessarily coming from a dynamical system). Subsection 5.3 describes a
construction of the first tiling Rk =
?
n?Zk W0(x, n). Subsection 5.4 uses the preparations
in Subsections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 and constructs ?(x), W (x, n) and w(x, n).
5.1. Quantitative persistence of zero points. We start from the following elementary
observation: Let f : Ck ? Ck be a holomorphic map such that f(0) = 0 and the derivative
df0 at the origin is an invertible matrix. For any neighborhood U of the origin in C
k, if
g : Ck ? Ck is a holomorphic map such that |f(z) ? g(z)| is sufficiently small over the
unit ball B1, then there exists z ? U such that g(z) = 0 and the derivative dgz at z
is also invertible. The purpose of this subsection is to develop a quantitative version of
this observation for some very special f (i.e. the function ?L introduced below). Here
“quantitative” means that we would like to specify how small |g(x)? f(x)| should be and
how much non-degenerate dgz is.
Let r > 0. For u ? C we define Dr(u) as the closed disk of radius r around u in C.
We set Dr = Dr(0). For u = (u1, . . . , uk) ? Ck we define the polydisc Dkr (u) in Ck by
Dkr (u) = Dr(u1)× · · · ×Dr(uk). We set Dkr = Dkr (0).
First we study the sine function sin z in the complex domain. Consider the image
sin(?D?/2) of the circle ?D?/2 of radius ?/2 under the map sin : C ? C. This curve does
not contain the origin and its rotation number around the origin is one:

sides of the above are isomorphic to Z.) The map sin? is the homomorphism induced by
the map sin : D?/2 \ {0} ? C \ {0}. The natural maps

? H1
(
D?/2 \ {0}

, H2 (C,C \ {0}) ? H1 (C \ {0})

by composition that
sin? : H2
(
D?/2, D?/2 \ {0}
)
? H2 (C,C \ {0})
is also an isomorphism. In the same way, for any n ? Z, the map
sin? : H2
(
D?/2(?n), D?/2(?n) \ {?n}

? H2 (C,C \ {0})
is an isomorphism.
Definition 5.1. (1) Recall that we introduced positive numbers a1, . . . , ak and ? in
Subsection 3.3. We set bi = ai + ?/2. For L > 1 we define ?L : C
k ? Ck by
?L(z1, . . . , zk) =
(
e?
?
?1 b1z1 sin(?z1/L), . . . , e
?
?
?1 bkzk sin(?zk/L)
)
.
This map vanishes on LZk. The Fourier transform of the i-th entry
e?
?
?1 biti sin(?ti/L), (t = (t1, . . . , tk) ? Rk)
of ?L|Rk (the restriction of ?L to Rk) is supported in

]
× {0}k?i, (1 ? i ? k).
We will choose a very large L later. So this line segment will be very small.
(2) Let A be a k × k matrix. We set
?(A) = min
z?Ck,|z|=1
|Az|.
The matrix A is invertible if and only if ?(A) > 0. So ?(A) quantifies the amount
of non-degeneracy of A. For another k × k matrix B we have
(5.1) |?(A)? ?(B)| ? |A?B| (the operator norm of A?B).
In particular ?(A) depends continuously on A.
Lemma 5.2. For every n = (n1, . . . , nk) ? Zk the homomorphism
(?L)? : H2k
(
DkL/2(Ln), D
k
L/2(Ln) \ {Ln}
)
? H2k
(
Ck,Ck \ {0}
)
is isomorphic. (Notice that the both sides are isomorphic to Z.)

Proof. We define a homotopy ft :
(
DkL/2(Ln), D

L/2(Ln) \ {Ln}
)
?
(
Ck,Ck \ {0}
)
for
0 ? t ? 1 by

(
e?
?
?1 t b1z1 sin(?z1/L), . . . , e

?
?1 t bkzk sin(?zk/L)
)
.
f1 = ?L. So it is enough to show that f0 induces an isomorphism on the 2k-th homology
groups (see [Hat02, Theorem 2.10]). The map f0 is given by
f0(z1, . . . , zk) = (sin(?z1/L), . . . , sin(?zk/L)) .
Set ?(z) = sin(?z/L) for z ? C. We have natural isomorphisms by the Ku?nneth theorem
(Spanier [Spa66, p. 235, 10 Theorem]):

Under these isomorphisms, the homomorphism (f0)? is identified with

By the argument in the beginning of this subsection, each factor
?? : H2
(

is isomorphic. Thus (f0)? is an isomorphism. 

we can choose r1 independent of L > 1. (This independence is a plausible fact but it is
not really needed in the argument below.)
It immediately follows from the definition that for all n ? Zk and z ? Dkr1(Ln)

Notation 5.4 (The threshold ?L). We define ? ? Ck as the set of z = (z1, . . . , zk)
satisfying |Im(zi)| ? 1 for all 1 ? i ? k. We define ?L > 0 as the minimum of the
following two quantities:
k?1/2(3/4)k+1

|?L(z)|

The next lemma is the main result of this subsection.
Lemma 5.5 (Persistence of zero points of ?L). Let f : C
k ? Ck be a holomorphic map.
Let W ? Ck be a subset and suppose |f(z) ? ?L(z)| < ?L for all z ? W . Then the
following (1) and (2) hold.
(1)
{z ? W ? ?| f(z) = 0} ?
?
n?Zk
Dkr1(Ln).
(2) For every n ? Zk with Dk1(Ln) ? W there exists z ? Dkr1(Ln) satisfying
f(z) = 0, ?(dfz) >
2
L
.
Proof. (1) is a direct consequence of the definition of ?L. So we consider (2). For the
notational simplicity, assume n = 0. It follows from the definition of ?L that
max
z??Dkr1
|f(z)??L(z)| < min
z??Dkr1
|?L(z)|,
where ?Dkr1 is the boundary of D
k
r1 . (So in particular its (2k ? 1)-th homology group is
isomorphic to Z.) Then we can define a homotopy ft : ?D
k
r1
? Ck \ {0} between ?L and
f by
ft(z) = (1? t)?L(z) + tf(z), (0 ? t ? 1).
Here the point is that ft has no zero on ?D
k
r1
. It follows from Lemma 5.2 that f? =
(?L)? : H2k?1(?D
k
r1
) ? H2k?1
(
Ck \ {0}
)
is isomorphic. Then f must attain zero at some
(interior) point of Dkr1. Otherwise the map f? : H2k?1
(
?Dkr1
)
? H2k?1
(
Ck \ {0}
)
is equal
to the composition of the maps
H2k?1
(
?Dkr1
)
? H2k?1
(
Dkr1
) f?? H2k?1
(
Ck \ {0}
)
.
But H2k?1
(
Dkr1
)
= 0 implies that the map f? : H2k?1
(
?Dkr1
)
? H2k?1
(
Ck \ {0}
)
is zero.
This is a contradiction.
The rest of the work is to prove the statement about the derivative of f at zero points.
By (5.1) and (5.2) it is enough to prove that for all z ? Dkr1 the operator norm of
dfz ? (d?L)z is smaller than 1/L. Let z = (z1, . . . , zk) ? Dkr1 . By the Cauchy integration
formula,

5.2. Tiling-like band-limited maps. We choose a rapidly decreasing function ?1 :
Rk ? R satisfying suppF(?1) ? B?/8 and
(5.3) F(?1)(0) =

?1(t) dt1 . . . dtk = 1.
Notation 5.6. We set
K1 =

|?1(t)| dt1 . . . dtk.
The function ?1 can be extended holomorphically over C

?1?·z d?1 . . . d?k, (z = (z1, . . . , zk) ? Ck).

Hence there exists a positive constant constP depending on P and satisfying

In particular for each l ? 0 there exists a constant constl satisfying
(5.4) |?1(z)| ? constl · (1 + |z|)?l · e(??/4)|Im(z)|.
It follows that the integral ?
Rk

converges and becomes a holomorphic function in z ? Ck. It is constantly equal to one
for z ? Rk by (5.3). Therefore indeed it is identically equal to one:

Let W = {Wn}n?Zk be a set of bounded convex sets of Rk (indexed by Zk) such that it
tiles the whole space Rk, namely
• Rk = ?n?Zk Wn.
• For any two distinct m and n in Zk the sets Wm and Wn intersect at most on their
boundaries ?Wm and ?Wn: Wm ?Wn = ?Wm ? ?Wn.
Notice that some Wn may be empty. For L > 1 we define a tiling-like band-limited
map ?L (W) : Ck ? Ck by
?L (W) (z) =

?L(t? n) 1Wn(t), (t ? Rk).
Namely we would like to “paint” the map ?L(t ? n) over each tile Wn. But this is not
even continuous in t. So instead we defined ?L (W) as in the above.
It follows from ||?L||L?(Rk) =

for all 1 ? i ? k. By (5.4) we can choose E = E(L) > 0 such that for all z ? ?

IntrA = A \ ?rA, namely IntrA is the set of t ? A satisfying Br(t) ? A.
Lemma 5.8. Let n ? Zk and z ? ?. If Re(z) ? IntEWn then
|?L (W) (z)??L(z ? n)| < ?L.

This is smaller than ?L by the definition of E. 
The next lemma is the summary of this subsection.
Lemma 5.9 (Main properties of ?L (W)). (1) The restriction of ?L (W) to Rk is a
bounded continuous map such that ||?L (W)||L?(Rk) ?

(2) Let n ? Zk and z ? ?. If Re(z) ? IntEWn and ?L (W) (z) = 0 then there exists
m ? Zk satisfying z ? Dkr1(n+ Lm).
(3) Let n,m ? Zk with n + Lm ? IntE+?kWn. Then there exists z ? Dkr1(n + Lm)
satisfying
?L (W) (z) = 0, ? ((d?L (W))z) >

Proof. (1) was already proved. (2) follows from Lemmas 5.5 (1) and 5.8. For (3), notice
that n + Lm ? IntE+?kWn implies B?k(n + Lm) ? IntE(Wn) and that every point
z ? Dk1(n + Lm) satisfies Re(z) ? IntE(Wn). Then (3) follows from Lemmas 5.5 (2) and
5.8. 

Conditions (2) and (3) in Lemma 5.9 are the rigorous formulation of “good/bad de-
composition” explained in Subsection 1.4. The domain ? is decomposed into two regions:
Good region =

IntE+
?
kWn
}
,
Bad region =
{
z ? ?
?????Rez ?

?E+
?

}
.
The above (2) and (3) mean that we have a good control (for our purpose here) of zero
points of ?L (W) over the good region. As we explained in Subsection 1.4, the bad
region should be “tiny”. This means that we need to introduce a tiling W such that the
“boundary region” ?
n?Zk
?E+
?
kWn
is sufficiently small. (Indeed we will need a bit more involved condition later; see (5.9)
below). The purpose of the next subsection is to construct such tilings.
5.3. Dynamical Voronoi diagram. This subsection is largely a reproduction of [GLT16,
Section 4]. Here we introduce a dynamically generated Voronoi diagram. Our use of
Voronoi diagram is conceptually influenced by the works of Lightwood [Lig03, Lig04].
Let (X,Zk, T ) be a dynamical system having the marker property as we promised in
Subsection 3.3. Let M be a natural number. It follows from the marker property that
there exists an open set U ? X satisfying
U ? T nU = ? (0 < |n| < M), X =
?
n?Zk
T nU.
We can find a natural number M1 ? M and a compact set F ? U satisfying X =?
|n|<M1 T
nF . Choose a continuous function h : X ? [0, 1] satisfying supp h ? U and
h = 1 on F . Then it satisfies
(5.6) (supp h)?T n (supp h) = ? (0 < |n| < M), X =
?
|n|<M1
T n ({x ? X| h(x) = 1}) .
For x ? X consider the following discrete set in Rk+1:
{(
n,
1
h(T nx)
)????n ? Zk, h(T nx) > 0
}
.
We consider the Voronoi diagram determined by this set. Namely we define a convex
set V0(x, n) for n ? Zk as follows: If h(T nx) = 0 then we set V0(x, n) = ?. If h(T nx) > 0
then we define it as the set of all u ? Rk+1 satisfying
?m ? Zk with h(Tmx) > 0 :
????u?

Figure 5.2. Voronoi tiling. The Voronoi center (n, 1/h(T nx)) is located
inside V0(x, n). The shadowed region is W0(x, n).
The sets V0(x, n) form a tiling of R
k+1:
Rk+1 =
?
n?Zk
V0(x, n).
Let ?Rk : R
k+1 ? Rk be the projection to the first k coordinates (i.e. forgetting the last
coordinate). Set H =
(
M1 +
?
k
)2
and
W0(x, n) = ?Rk
(
V0(x, n) ?
(
Rk × {?H}
))
.
See Figure 5.2. These form a tiling of Rk:
Rk =
?
n?Zk
W0(x, n).
This tiling is Zk-equivariant in the sense that
W0(T
nx,m) = ?n+W0(x, n+m) = {?n + u| u ? W0(x, n +m)}.
The tiles W0(x, n) depend continuously on x ? X in the Hausdorff topology. More
precisely, for ? > 0 and for each x ? X and n ? Zk with IntW0(x, n) 6= ?, if y ? X
is sufficiently close to x, then the Hausdorff distance between W0(x, n) and W0(y, n) is
smaller than ?. Here IntW0(x, n) denotes the interior ofW0(x, n). (When the tileW0(x, n)
has no interior point, it may vanish after x moves slightly. But this does not cause any
problem.)
The set W0(x, n) depends on the choice of the parameter M . So we sometimes write
WM0 (x, n) = W0(x, n) for clarifying that M is the parameter
11. In the next subsection
we consider the tiling-like band-limited map for this tiling. The following property of
11It might look that M1 and h are also parameters. But we can choose them to be functions of M .
Namely for each natural number M we fix a natural number M1 = M1(M) and a continuous function
h = hM : X ? [0, 1] satisfying (5.6). Then only M remains to be a parameter.
40 YONATAN GUTMAN, YIXIAO QIAO, MASAKI TSUKAMOTO
WM0 (x, n) becomes crucial there, which means that the “bad region” is negligible as we
explained at the end of the last section.

Claim 5.11. Let x ? X and n ? Zk with h(T nx) > 0.
(1) V0(x, n) contains the ball BM/2 (n, 1/h(T

(2) W0(x, n) ? BM1+?k(n).
(3) If W0(x, n) 6= ? then h(T nx) > 1/2.
Proof. It follows from the first property of h in (5.6) that ifm ? Zk also satisfies h(Tmx) >
0 then |n?m| ? M . Property (1) easily follows from this. For the proof of (2) and (3),
take u ? W0(x, n). Let v ? Zk be the integer point closest to u. By the second property
of h in (5.6) there exists m ? Zk satisfying |m| < M1 and h(T v+mx) = 1. It follows from
the definition of the Voronoi tiling that
(5.7)
????(u,?H)?
(
n,

h(T nx)

Since |H + 1/h(T nx)| ? H + 1,
|u? n| ? |u? v ?m| < |u? v|+M1 <
?
k +M1.
This proves (2). It follows from (5.7) that

where ?Rk : R
k+1 ? Rk is the projection to the first k coordinates. It follows from the
same proof of Claim 5.11 (2) that
W1(x, n) ? BM1+?k(n).
For u ? W1(x, n) we denote by (f(u),?H) the intersection point of the hyperplane
Rk×{?H} and the line segment between (u,?cH) and the Voronoi center (n, 1/h(T nx)).
It follows from the convexity of V0(x, n) that f(u) ? W0(x, n). See Figure 5.3.

(2) |IntrW0(x, n)| ? (1? ?) |W1(x, n)|.
Proof. (1) From BM/2 (n, 1/h(T

Let x ? X . We define ?A,L0,L(x) = ?L ({W0(x, n)}n?Zk) : Ck ? Ck as the tiling-like

which are disjoint with each other.
(3) Equivariance: ?(T nx)(z) = ?(x)(z + n) for all x ? X, n ? Zk and z ? Ck.
(4) Continuity: If a sequence xn in X converges to x then ?(xn) converges to ?(x)
uniformly over every compact subset of Ck.
Proof. (1) and (2) immediately follow from Lemma 5.9 (1). (3) and (4) follow from the
equivariance and continuity of the tiles W0(x, n). 
Let 0 < r1 < 1/4 be the positive number introduced in Notation 5.3. Let ?1 : C
k ?
[0, 1] and ?2 : R ? [0, 1] be continuous functions satisfying
?1(z) = 1
(
z ? Dkr1
)
, ?1(z) = 0
(
z /? Dk2r1
)
,
?2(t) = 0
(
t ? 1
L
)
, ?2(t) = 1
(
t ? 2
L
)
.
For each x ? X and n ? Zk we define a non-negative number ?A,L0,L(x, n) = ?(x, n) by
?(x, n) = min
?
?
?1,
?
?(x)(z)=0
?1(z ? n)?2 (? (d?(x)z))
?
?
? .
Here the sum is taken over all z ? Ck satisfying ?(x)(z) = 0, z ? Dk2r1(n) and ? (d?(x)z) ?
1/L. The set of such z is a finite set because non-degenerate zero points are isolated. So
this is a finite sum. (Notice that the polydisk Dk2r1(n) may contain infinitely many zeros of
?(x). The above definition of ?(x, n) addresses this problem. The number 1/L is chosen
44 YONATAN GUTMAN, YIXIAO QIAO, MASAKI TSUKAMOTO
so that the zero points found in Lemma 5.9 (3) contribute to the above sum.) For each
n ? Zk the number ?(x, n) depends continuously on x ? X .
We again consider a Voronoi tiling. Let x ? X . Consider the following discrete set in
Rk+1: {(
n,
1
?(x, n)
)????n ? Zk, ?(x, n) > 0
}
.
This set is not empty. (See the proof of Lemma 5.15 (1) below.) So this determines a
Voronoi diagram. Namely for n ? Zk we define V (x, n) as the set of u ? Rk+1 satisfying
?m ? Zk with ?(x,m) > 0 :
????u?
(
n,
1
?(x, n)
)???? ?
????u?
(
m,
1
?(x,m)
)???? .
If ?(x, n) = 0 then V (x, n) = ?. These form a tiling of Rk+1:
Rk+1 =
?
n?Zk
V (x, n).
We set W (x, n) = ?Rk
(
V (x, n) ?
(
Rk × {0}
))
, where ?Rk : R
k+1 ? Rk is the projection
to the first k coordinates as before. The sets W (x, n) form a tiling of Rk:
Rk =
?
n?Zk
W (x, n).
This is also Zk-equivariant, namely W (T nx,m) = ?n +W (x, n + m). Each W (x, n) is
a bounded convex set of Rk (see Lemma 5.15 (1) below) and depends continuously on
x ? X in the Hausdorff topology as in the case ofW0(x, n). We sometimes denoteW (x, n)
by WA,L0,L(x, n) for clarifying the dependence on the parameters A,L0, L. For x ? X we
define ?(x) = ?A,L0,L(x) as
?
n?Zk ?W (x, n).

uniformly in x ? X and n ? Zk. Moreover

(2) Let ?3 : R ? [0, 3] be a continuous function satisfying
?3(t) = 3 (t ? L0), ?3(t) = 0 (t ? L0 + 1).
There exists R0 = R0(A,L0, L) > 0 such that for all x ? X and all u ? Zk

Proof. Let x ? X and n ? Zk. It follows from Lemma 5.9 (2) and (3) that

(5.10) that ?(x,m) = 1. By the Zk-equivariance we conclude that for any p ? Zk there
exists an integer point q ? BR+L?k(p) satisfying ?(x, q) = 1.
Take u ? W (x, n). Let p be the integer point closest to u. Then we can find an integer
point q ? BR+L?k(p) satisfying ?(x, q) = 1. It follows form the definition of the Voronoi

(5.15)
By combining (5.14), (5.15) with Condition 5.13 and (5.9), we can conclude that (5.13)
holds for sufficiently large R. 
As we explained in Subsection 3.2 we need a social welfare system among the tiles
W (x, n). The next proposition provides it.
Proposition 5.16 (Construction of weight functions). We can construct a continuous
map
(5.16) X ?
(
[0, 1]Z
k
)Zk
, x 7? (w(x, n))n?Zk , where w(x, n) = (wm(x, n))m?Zk ? [0, 1]Z
k
satisfying the following.
(1) The map is equivariant in the sense that for all m,n ? Zk and x ? X
w(Tmx, n) = w(x, n+m).
(2) If x, y ? X satisfy ?(x) = ?(y) then w(x, n) = w(y, n) for all n ? Zk.
(3) For all x ? X and n ? Zk
#{m ? Zk|wm(x, n) > 0} < 1 +
1
A
|IntL0W (x, n)| .
In particular if IntL0W (x, n) = ? then wm(x, n) = 0 for all m ? Zk.
(4) Let x ? X and p ? Zk with d (p, ?(x)) ? L0. There exists n ? Zk ? BR0(p) satis-
fying wp?n(x, n) = 1. Here R0 = R0(A,L0, L) is the positive number introduced in
Lemma 5.15 (2).
We call w(x, n) weight functions and sometimes write wA,L0,L(x, n) = w(x, n) for
clarifying the dependence on parameters.
Probably the intuitive meaning of the statement is not clear at all. So we explain it
before the proof. (The idea of the social welfare system was first introduced in [GT]. The
explanation below is more or less a reproduction of the argument around [GT, Lemma
6.4].) In the proof of Proposition 3.1 we construct a perturbation g1(x) of a given band-
limited function f(x) for each x ? X . It is difficult to construct a perturbation over
the whole space Rk at once. So we will perturb f(x) over each tile W (x, n) separately.
The difficulty arises near the boundary ?W (x, n). The parameter L0 will be chosen so
48 YONATAN GUTMAN, YIXIAO QIAO, MASAKI TSUKAMOTO
that we can construct a good perturbation in IntL0W (x, n). But we cannot control the
perturbation over ?L0W (x, n). (Note that if the tile W (x, n) is tiny, it may be contained
in ?L0W (x, n). So the problem is approximately equivalent to “how to help small tiles”.)
The function g1(x) should encode the information of the orbit of x ? X . The above
argument means that it becomes difficult to encode the information of T px for p ? Zk with
d (p, ?(x)) ? L0. The weight functions wm(x, n) help with this situation. Roughly (and
very inaccurately) speaking, we will encode the (100× wm(x, n))% of the information of
T n+mx to g1(x)|W (x,n). So wm(x, n) is the “amount of help” that the tile W (x, n) gives to
the point n+m. In particular, if wm(x, n) = 1 then the information of T
n+mx is perfectly
encoded into g1(x)|W (x,n).
Now we can explain the intuitive meaning of the above (1)–(4). Condition (1) is an ob-
vious requirement. Condition (2)12 means that the weight function w(x, n) is determined
by the tiling-like band-limited map ?(x). Condition (3) means that the amount of “addi-
tional encoding” which W (x, n) has to bear is controlled by the volume of IntL0W (x, n).
Condition (4) means that every point near the boundary ?(x) is “successfully rescued” by
some large tile. Namely we can solve all the difficulties coming from the boundary effect.
Proof of Proposition 5.16. We fix a bijection between Zk and N = {1, 2, 3, . . .}
N ? l 7? ml ? Zk
such that if l1 < l2 then |ml1 | ? |ml2 |. (Then in particular m1 = 0.)
Fix x ? X . For n ? Zk we set
u0(n) =
|IntL0W (x, n)|
A
, v0(n) = ?3 (d (n, ?(x))) .
Here ?3 : R ? [0, 3] is the continuous function introduced in Lemma 5.15 (2). We define
?l(n), ul(n), vl(n) inductively with respect to l ? 1 by
?l(n) = min (ul?1(n), vl?1(n+ml)) ,
ul(n) = ul?1(n)? ?l(n),
vl(n) = vl?1(n)? ?l(n?ml).
This process can be explained in “social welfare” terms:
• The tiles W (x, n) should pay tax. Tax is used for helping integer points p ? Zk.
The tile W (x, n) can pay at most u0(n) and the point p needs v0(p).
• At the l-th step of the induction, the tile W (x, n) gives the money ?l(n) to the
point n +ml. After the step, W (x, n) still can pay ul(n) and points p still need
vl(p).
12The above explanation does not feature Condition (2). But indeed this is a very important condition.
It did not appear in the paper [GT]. A substantial amount of the argument in this section has been
developed for establishing this condition.
EMBEDDING PROBLEM OF Zk-ACTIONS 49
Figure 5.4. At the l-th step of the induction, the tile W (x, n) gives the
amount of money ?l(n) to the point n +ml. Before this step, W (x, n) has
the amount of money ul?1(n) and the point n + ml needs vl?1(n + ml).
After this step, either W (x, n) loses all its money (i.e. ul(n) = 0) or n+ml
becomes satisfied (i.e. vl(n+ml) = 0). Namely, min (ul(n), vl(n+ml)) = 0.
• At each step, W (x, n) pays as much as possible. Namely, after the l-th step, at
least one of ul(n) and vl(n + ml) is zero. This is a key property of the process.
Figure 5.4 schematically explains the process.
Set l0 = #
(
Zk ?BR0
)
. Then Zk ? BR0 = {m1, . . . , ml0}. It follows from Lemma 5.15
(2) that this process terminates: For all l ? l0 and n ? Zk
vl(n) = 0, ?l+1(n) = 0,
because if vl0(n0) > 0 for some n0 then ul0(n) = 0 for all n ? BR0(n0) and hence
?
n?BR0 (n0)
u0(n) =

n?BR0 (n0)
l0?
l=1
?l(n) <
?
n?B2R0 (n0)
v0(n),
which contradicts Lemma 5.15 (2).
It follows from the construction that for n, p ? Zk

?l(n) ? u0(n) =
|IntL0W (x, n)|
A
,
(5.18)
l0?

?l(p?ml) = v0(p) = ?3 (d (n, ?(x))) .
We define continuous functions ?4 : R ? [1, 2l0] and ?5 : R ? [0, 1] such that
?4(0) = 2l0, ?4(t) = 1 (t ? 1),
?5(t) = 0 (t ? 1), ?5(t) = 1 (t ? 2).
We define F : Rl0 ? Rl0 by F (x1, . . . , xl0) = (y1, . . . , yl0) where
yl0 = 2l0xl0 , yl0?1 = ?4(yl0)xl0?1, yl0?2 = ?4 (max(yl0, yl0?1))xl0?2, . . .
y1 = ?4 (max(yl0, . . . , y2))x1.
50 YONATAN GUTMAN, YIXIAO QIAO, MASAKI TSUKAMOTO
This satisfies
(5.19) #{1 ? l ? l0| yl > 1} ? 1 + #{1 ? l ? l0| xl > 1}.
We define G : Rl0 ? [0, 1]l0 by G(y1, . . . , yl0) = (?5(y1), . . . , ?5(yl0)). Then it follows from
the above (5.19) that if we set GF (x1, . . . , xl0) = (z1, . . . , zl0) then
(5.20) #{1 ? l ? l0| zl > 0} ? 1 + #{1 ? l ? l0| xl > 1}.
We define wm(x, n) for |m| ? R0 and n ? Zk by
(
wm1(x, n), wm2(x, n), . . . , wml0 (x, n)
)
= GF (?1(n), . . . , ?l0(n)) .
We set wm(x, n) = 0 for |m| > R0.
Now we have defined the map (5.16) in the statement. We need to check its properties.
It is continuous and equivariant (i.e. Property (1)) because the tiles W (x, n) depend
continuously on x ? X and W (Tmx, n) = ?m +W (x, n + m). Property (2) is obvious
because the tiles W (x, n) are constructed from the function ?(x).
Fix x ? X again. From (5.17)
#{1 ? l ? l0|?l(n) > 1} <
|IntL0W (x, n)|
A
.
Then Property (3) follows from (5.20):
#{m|wm(x, n) > 0} ? 1 + #{1 ? l ? l0|?l(n) > 1} < 1 +
|IntL0W (x, n)|
A
.
Finally we check Property (4). Let p ? Zk with d (p, ?(x)) ? L0. Then v0(p) = 3. From
(5.18)
l0?
l=1
?l(p?ml) = 3.
We define l1 as the maximum of 1 ? l ? l0 satisfying ?l(p?ml) > 0. If ?l1(p?ml1) ? 2
then wml1 (p?ml1) = 1. Otherwise
l1?1?
l=1
?l(p?ml) > 1.
Then there exists l2 < l1 satisfying
?l2(p?ml2) >
1
l1
? 1
l0
.
The condition l2 < l1 implies ul2(p?ml2) = 0 (otherwise vl2(p) = 0 and ?l1(p?ml1) = 0)

6. Proof of Main Proposition
We prove Proposition 3.1 in this section. We recommend readers to review the notations
introduced in Subsection 3.3. We repeat the statement of the proposition (assuming the
notations in Subsection 3.3):
Proposition 6.1 (= Proposition 3.1). Let d be a distance onX and f : X ? B1(a1, . . . , ak)
a Zk-equivariant continuous map. Then there exists a Zk-equivariant continuous map
g : X ? B1(a1 + ?, . . . , ak + ?) such that
• ||g(x)? f(x)||L?(Rk) < ? for all x ? X.
• g is a ?-embedding with respect to the distance d.
We can assume ||f(x)||L?(Rk) ? 1 ? ? for all x ? X by replacing f with (1 ? ?)f if
necessary. We fix 0 < ?? < ? satisfying
(6.1) 4K0?
? < ?
where K0 is the positive number introduced in Notation 4.1 (1). We choose 0 < ? < ?
such that for any x, y ? X
(6.2) d(x, y) < ? =? ||f(x)? f(y)||L?([0,1]k) < ?
?.
From mdim(X) < ?1 . . . ?k/2 we can find c0 > 1 and a natural number N such that

We take a simplicial complex Q and an ?-embedding ? : (X, d) ? Q.
We define the cone CP as [0, 1] × P/ ?, where (0, p) ? (0, q) for all p, q ? P . We
denote by tp the equivalence class of (t, p) ? [0, 1] × P . We set ? = 0p and call it the
vertex of the cone. We define CQ in the same way. It follows from (6.3) that

Notation 6.2 (Fixing the parameters A,L0, L). We take positive numbers A,L0 and L
satisfying the following conditions.
(1) c1A > 2 dimCQ.
(2) L0 is sufficiently larger than r2 + N
?

??Intr2+N?kW

The second condition is satisfied for sufficiently large L0 by Lemma 2.7.
(3) L > 4/? (see Lemma 5.14 (2)) and Condition 5.13 holds.
For these A,L0 and L we construct the tiles W (x, n) = W
A,L0,L(x, n) and the weight
functions w(x, n) = wA,L0,L(x, n) as in Subsection 5.4.
Lemma 6.3. Let x ? X and n ? Zk. We define
#(x, n) = #{m ? Zk|wm(x, n) > 0}.
If IntL0W (x, n) 6= ? then

Notation 6.4 (Choice of R). We take a positive number R such that
• R ? NZ.
• R > R0(A,L0, L) where R0(A,L0, L) is the positive number introduced in Lemma
5.15 (2).
EMBEDDING PROBLEM OF Zk-ACTIONS 53
• For all x ? X and n ? Rk, the tile W (x, n) satisfies ?n +W (x, n) ? [?R,R)k,
where ?n + W (x, n) = {?n + t| t ? W (x, n)}. This condition is satisfied for
sufficiently large R by Lemma 5.15 (1).
We set
P = (CP )[?R,R)
k?NZk , Q = (CQ)[?R,R)
k?Zk .
For i ? 0 we define Q(i) ? Q as the set of (qn)n?[?R,R)k?Zk satisfying qn = ? except
for at most i entries. In particular Q(0) = {(?, . . . , ?)} and dimQ(i) ? i dimCQ. Let
W ? [?R,R)k be a convex set. We define P(W ) ? P as the set of (pn)n?[?R,R)k?NZk
such that if W ?
(

dimP(W ) ?

n?[?R,R)k?NZk
.
?W is an ?-embedding with respect to the distance dIntW?Zk , where IntW is the interior
of W . It follows from Lemma 6.3 that for any x ? X and n ? Zk with IntL0W (x, n) 6= ?
(6.11) dim (P (?n +W (x, n))×Q (#(x, n))) < ?1 . . . ?k
2
??Intr2+N?kW (x, n)
?? .
Recall that we introduced lattices ? and ?1 of R
k in Subsection 3.3. Applying Lemma
2.5 to the ?-embedding ? : (X, d[N ]) ? P and a map
X ? R??[0,N)k , x 7? (f(x)(?))????[0,N)k ,
we can find a simplicial map F : P ? R??[0,N)k satisfying
?x ? X, ? ? ? ? [0, N)k : |F (?(x)) (?)? f(x)(?)| < ??.
We extend F over CP by F (tp) = tF (p). We define a simplicial map G : P × Q ?
R??[?R,R)
k
as follows: For p = (pn)n?[?R,R)k?NZk ? P , q ? Q, n ? [?R,R)k ? NZk and
? ? ? ? [0, N)k
G(p, q)(n+ ?) = F (pn)(?).
Using Lemma 2.6 (2), we perturb G and construct a simplicial map G : P × Q ?
R??[?R,R)
k
satisfying the following.
Property 6.5 (Properties on G). (1) G is sufficiently close to G in the sense that for
all (p, q) ? P ×Q and ? ? ? ? [?R,R)k
|G(p, q)(?)?G(p, q)(?)| < ?? ? sup
x?X,????[0,N)k
|F (?(x)) (?)? f(x)(?)| .
This implies that for all convex sets W ? [?R,R)k, x ? X and q ? Q

(2) If a convex set W ? [?R,R)k, i ? 0 and a subset ? ? ? ? [?R,R)k satisfy
dim (P(W )×Q(i)) < |?|
2
,
then the map
P(W )×Q(i) ? R?, (p, q) 7? G(p, q)|?
is an embedding.
Now we are ready to prove the main proposition.
Proof of Proposition 3.1. We choose continuous functions ?1, ?2 : R ? [0, 1] satisfying
?1(t) = 0 (t ? r0), ?1(t) = 1 (t ? r0 + 1),
?2(t) = 0
(
t ? N

)
, ?2(t) = 1
(
t ? r0 +N

)
.
Let x ? X . Recall that we introduced ?(x) = ?n?Zk ?W (x, n). We define px : ?1 ? [0, 1]
and ux = (ux(?))???1 ? ??(?1) as follows: For ? ? ?1
• If there exists n ? Zk satisfying ? ? (n+ ?) ?W (x, n) then
px(?) =?1 (d(?, ?(x))) ,
ux(?) =?2 (d(?, ?(x))) {?f(x)(?)
+G
(
??n+W (x,n)(T
nx),
(
wm(x, n) · ?(T n+mx)
)
m?[?R,R)k?Zk
)
(?? n)}.
• Otherwise we set px(?) = 0 and ux(?) = 0.
px is an admissible function in the sense of Definition 4.2 (2). It follows from Property
6.5 (1) with f(x)(?) = f(T nx)(?? n) that
(6.12) ||ux||? < ??.
Since the tiles W (x, n) and the weight functions w(x, n) depend continuously on x ? X ,
the numbers px(?) and ux(?) depend continuously on x for each fixed ? ? ?1. We set
g1(x) = f(x) + ?(px, ux) ? B(a1, . . . , ak)
where ? is the interpolating function introduced in Section 4. By the continuity of ?
(Proposition 4.9), g1(x) depends continuously on x ? X . Since the tiles W (x, n) and
the weight functions w(x, n) satisfy the natural Zk-equivariance, px(?) and ux(?) also
satisfy the Zk-equivariance (i.e. pTnx(?) = px(? + n) and uTnx(?) = ux(? + n)). The
interpolating function ? also satisfies it (Lemma 4.7 (3)). Therefore the map X ? x 7?
g1(x) ? B1(a1, . . . , ak) is Zk-equivariant. By Lemma 4.7 (2) and (6.12)
||g1(x)? f(x)||L?(Rk) = ||?(px, ux)||L?(Rk)
< 2K0?

(we assumed 4K0?

(6.13)
EMBEDDING PROBLEM OF Zk-ACTIONS 55
Let ?A,L0,L(x) = (?(x)1, . . . ,?(x)k) : C
k ? Ck be the tiling-like band-limited map
introduced in Subsection 5.4 for the parameters A,L0, L in Notation 6.2. We define
g2(x) : R
k ? R by
g2(x) =
?
2kK1
Re
(
k?
i=1
?(x)i

.
It follows from ||?(x)||L?(Rk) ?
?
kK1 (Lemma 5.14 (1)) that
(6.14) ||g2(x)||L?(Rk) ?
?

.
By Lemma 5.14 (2) with L > 4/?, the Fourier transform of each ?(x)i|Rk is supported in
?i

)
×
(

)k?i
, (1 ? i ? k).
Then the Fourier transform of g2(x) is supported in
(6.15)
k?
i=1
?i ? (??i), (??i = {??| ? ? ?i}).
This is contained in
?k
i=1[?(ai + ?)/2, (ai + ?)/2]. So g2(x) ? B(a1 + ?, . . . , ak + ?). The
map X ? x 7? g2(x) ? B(a1 + ?, . . . , ak + ?) is continuous and Zk-equivariant by the
corresponding properties of ?(x) in Lemma 5.14 (3) and (4).
Finally we set g(x) = g1(x) + g2(x). By (6.13) and (6.14)
||f(x)? g(x)||L?(Rk) < ?.
In particular ||g(x)||L?(Rk) < 1 by the assumption ||f(x)||L?(Rk) ? 1 ? ? in the beginning
of the section. The map
X ? x 7? g(x) ? B1(a1 + ?, . . . , ak + ?)
is continuous and Zk-equivariant.
We need to prove that g : X ? B1(a1 + ?, . . . , ak + ?) is a ?-embedding with respect to
d. Suppose g(x) = g(y) for some x, y ? X . We would like to show d(x, y) < ?. It follows
from g(x) = g(y) that g1(x) = g1(y) and g2(x) = g2(y) because the Fourier transforms
of g1(x) and g1(y) are supported in
?k
i=1[?ai/2, ai/2], which is disjoint with (6.15). The
equation g2(x) = g2(y) implies ?(x)i = ?(y)i for all 1 ? i ? k because 2k sets ?i and ??i
are disjoint with each other. So ?(x) = ?(y). Then it follows that W (x, n) = W (y, n)
and w(x, n) = w(y, n) for all n ? Zk because the tiles W (x, n) and the weight functions
w(x, n) are constructed from the tiling-like band-limited map ?(x).
Case 1: Suppose d (0, ?(x)) > L0. Then there exists n ? Zk satisfying 0 ? IntL0W (x, n).
For all ? ? (n+ ?) ? Intr0+N?kW (x, n)
px(?) = 1,
ux(?) = ?f(x)(?) +G

It follows from the interpolation property of ? in Lemma 4.7 (1) that for all ? ? (n +

(6.17)
is an embedding. Thus g1(x) = g1(y) implies that ??n+W (x,n)(T
nx) = ??n+W (y,n)(T
ny).
Recall that the map ??n+W (x,n) is an ?-embedding with respect to the distance d?n+IntW (x,n).
It follows from 0 ? IntL0W (x, n) that ?n ? ?n + IntW (x, n). Thus we get
d(x, y) ? d?n+IntW (x,n)(T nx, T ny) < ? < ?.
Case 2: Suppose d (0, ?(x)) ? L0. It follows from Proposition 5.16 (3) and (4) that
there exists n ? BR0 ?Zk satisfying IntL0W (x, n) 6= ? and w?n(x, n) = w?n(y, n) = 1. As
in Case 1, we have the same formula (6.16) for all ? ? (n + ?) ? Intr0+N?kW (x, n). The
map (6.17) is also an embedding. Then the equation g1(x) = g1(y) implies that
(
wm(x, n) · ?(T n+mx)
)
m?[?R,R)k?Zk =
(
wm(y, n) · ?(T n+my)
)
m?[?R,R)k?Zk .
Since w?n(x, n) = w?n(y, n) = 1, we get ?(x) = ?(y). Thus d(x, y) < ? < ? because
? : X ? Q is an ?-embedding with respect to d. 
Now we have completed the proof of Main Theorem 2 (and hence the proof of Main
Theorem 1).
7. Open problems
Here we explain major open problems in the direction of the paper.
(1) From Main Theorem 1, we have a good understanding of when dynamical systems
can be embedded in
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
under the assumption of the marker property. So
the next step is how to remove the assumption. We would like to propose
EMBEDDING PROBLEM OF Zk-ACTIONS 57
Conjecture 7.1. Let (X,Zk, T ) be a dynamical system. For a subgroup A ? Zk
we define XA ? X as the space of x ? X satisfying T ax = x for all a ? A. The
quotient group Zk/A naturally acts on XA. Then X can be embedded in the shift
on
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
if for every subgroup A ? Zk the mean dimension of XA with respect
to the (Zk/A)-action is smaller than D/2.
If Zk/A is a finite group, then the mean dimension of XA is just
dimXA
#(Zk/A)
.
When k = 1, Conjecture 7.1 is equivalent to [LT14, Conjecture 1.2]. Notice that
if we set Y =
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
then for any subgroup A ? Zk the system YA is naturally
identified with
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk/A
, whose mean dimension is D. So Conjecture 7.1 can
be rephrased; if (X,Zk, T ) satisfies
? subgroup A ? Zk : mdim(XA) <
mdim(YA)
2
,
then it can be embedded in Y =
(
[0, 1]D
)Zk
.
(2) Let ? ? Rk be a compact subset. We define B1(?) as the space of continuous
functions f : Rk ? C satisfying suppf? ? ? and ||f ||L?(Rk) ? 1. The mean
dimension of the natural Zk-action on B1(?) is equal to 2|?|. (Here notice that
f are complex-valued functions. The factor 2 comes from dimC = 2.) We would
like to ask when a dynamical system (X,Zk, T ) can be embedded in the shift on
B1(?). By almost the same argument as the proof of Main Theorem 2, we can
prove
Theorem 7.2. Suppose ? is a rectangle (i.e. congruent to a set [a1, b1] × · · · ×
[ak, bk]). If a dynamical system (X,Z
k, T ) satisfies the marker property and
mdim(X) < |?| = (b1 ? a1)× · · · × (bk ? ak),
then we can embed it in the shift on B1(?).
The proof of this theorem is notationally more messy than the proof of Main
Theorem 2. So we concentrate on Main Theorem 2 in this paper.
If ? is not a rectangle, then the method of this paper does not work directly.
Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to conjecture that if ? is a “nice” set (e.g. a semi-
algebraic set) and if a dynamical system (X,Zk, T ) satisfies the marker property
and
mdim(X) < |?|
then X can be embedded in the shift on B1(?). We hope to return to this problem
in a future.
58 YONATAN GUTMAN, YIXIAO QIAO, MASAKI TSUKAMOTO
(3) An ambitious question is how to generalize Main Theorems 1 and 2 to the actions
of noncommutative groups. In particular it is very interesting to see what kind
of signal analysis should be involved. We don’t have an answer even for nilpotent
groups.
