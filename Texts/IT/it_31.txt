Abstract
Inferring the directionality of interactions between cellular processes is a major
challenge in systems biology. Time-lagged correlations allow to discriminate between
alternative models, but they still rely on assumed underlying interactions. Here, we
use the transfer entropy (TE), an information-theoretic quantity that quantifies the
directional influence between fluctuating variables in a model-free way. We present a
theoretical approach to compute the transfer entropy, even when the noise has an
extrinsic component or in the presence of feedback. We re-analyze the experimental
data from Kiviet et al. (2014) where fluctuations in gene expression of metabolic
enzymes and growth rate have been measured in single cells of E. coli. We confirm the
formerly detected modes between growth and gene expression, while prescribing more
stringent conditions on the structure of noise sources. We furthermore point out
practical requirements in terms of length of time series and sampling time which must
be satisfied in order to infer optimally transfer entropy from times series of
fluctuations.
Introduction
Quantifying information exchange between variables is a general goal in many studies
of biological systems because the complexity of such systems prohibits mechanistic
bottom-up approaches. Several statistical methods have been proposed to exploit
either the specific dependence of the covariances between input and output variables
with respect to a perturbation applied to the network [1], or the information contained
in 3-point correlations [2]. These methods are potentially well suited for datasets
obtained from destructive measurements, such as RNA sequencing or
immunohistochemistry.
However, none of these methods exploits the information contained in time-lagged
statistics, which is provided for instance by non-destructive measurements obtained
from time-lapse microscopy of single cells. Such experimental data should be quite
relevant to understand functional relationships since they merely reflect the time
PLOS 1/24
delays present in the dynamics of the system. Time-delayed cross-correlations between
gene expression fluctuations have indeed been shown to discriminate between several
mechanistic models of well characterized genetic networks [3]. However, such methods
become difficult to interpret in the presence of feedback.
This situation is illustrated in reference [4] where the fluctuations in the growth
rate and in the expression level of metabolic enzymes have been measured as a
function of time by tracking single cells of E. coli with time-lapse microscopy. The
interplay between these variables has been characterized using cross-correlations as
proposed in [3]. To circumvent the difficulty of discriminating between many complex
and poorly parametrized metabolic models, the authors reduced functional relations to
effective linear responses with a postulated form of effective couplings.
In the present work, we instead use a time-lagged and information-based method to
analyze the interplay between the two fluctuating variables. A crucial feature in this
method is that it is model-free and it is able to disentangle the two directions of
influence between the two variables, unlike the cross-correlations discussed above.
This type of approach was first proposed by Granger [5] in the field of econometrics
and found applications in a broader area. More recently, transfer entropy [6], which is
a non-linear extension of Granger causality, has become a popular
information-theoretic measure to infer directional relationships between jointly
dependent processes [7]. It has been successfully applied to various biomedical time
series (see for instance [8]) and extensively in the field of neurobiology, as shown in
Ref. [9] and in references therein. This is the tool that will be used in this work.
The plan of this paper is as follows. We first introduce two measures of information
dynamics, transfer entropy (TE) and information flow (IF). We then illustrate our
numerical method on a well controlled case, namely a simple linear Langevin model,
and show that we can properly estimate these quantities from the generated time
series. We then analyze experimental data on the fluctuations of metabolism of E. coli
taken from Ref. [4]. We provide analytical expressions for the transfer entropy and
information flow rates for the model proposed in that reference. After identifying a
divergence in one TE rate as the sampling time goes to zero, we introduce a simplified
model which is free of divergences while still being compatible with the experimental
data. We conclude that the inference of information-theoretic dynamical quantities
can be helpful to build physically sound models of the various noise components
present in chemical networks.
Information theoretic measures
Unlike the mutual information I(X : Y ) that only quantifies the amount of
information exchanged between two random variables X and Y as defined in the
section on Methods, the transfer entropy (TE) is an asymmetric measure that can
discriminate between a source and a target [6]. Consider two sampled time series
{..xi?1, xi, xi+1..} and {..yi?1, yi, yi+1..}, where i is the discrete time index, generated
by a source process X and a target process Y . The transfer entropy TX?Y from X to
Y is a conditional, history-dependent mutual information defined as
TX?Y =
?
P (yi+1, y
(k)
i ,x
(l)
i ) ln
P (yi+1|y(k)i ,x

P (yi+1|y(k)i )
,
=

[H(yi+1|y(k)i )?H(yi+1|y
(k)

where y
(k)
i = {yi?k+1, · · · , yi} and x
(l)
i = {xi?l+1, · · · , xi} denote two blocks of past
values of Y and X of length k and l respectively, P (yi+1, y

probability of observing yi+1, y

(l)
i , and P (yi+1|y
(k)
i ,x
(l)
i ), P (yi+1|y
(k)

PLOS 2/24
conditional probabilities. In the second line, H(.|.) denotes the conditional Shannon
entropy. In both equations, the summations are taken over all possible values of the
random variables yi+1, y
(k)
i ,x
(l)
i and over all values of the time index i.
To put it in simple terms, TX?Y quantifies the information contained from the past
of X about the future of Y , which the past of Y did not already provide [7, 8].
Therefore, it should be regarded as a measure of predictability rather than a measure
of causality between two time-series [10]. For instance, when x
(l)
i does not bring new
information on yi+1, then P (yi+1|y(k)i ,x
(l)
i ) = P (yi+1|y
(k)
i ) and the transfer entropy
vanishes because the prediction on yi+1 is not improved. With a similar definition for
TY?X , one can define the net variation of transfer entropy from X to Y as
?TX?Y ? TX?Y ? TY?X . The sign of ?TX?Y informs on the directionality of the
information transfer.
The statistics required for properly evaluating the transfer entropy rapidly
increases with k and l, which in practice prohibits the use of large values of k and l.
The most accessible case thus corresponds to k = l = 1, which we denote hereafter as
TX?Y . This quantity is then simply defined as
TX?Y =
?[
H(yi+1|yi)?H(yi+1|yi, xi)
]
, (2)
When the dynamics of the joint process {X,Y } is Markovian, one has
P (yi+1|y(k)i ,x
(l)
i ) = P (yi+1|yi, xi) and since H(yi+1|y
(k)
i ) ? H(yi+1|yi) one has
TX?Y ? TX?Y (see Ref. [11]). Therefore, TX?Y represents an upper bound on the
transfer entropy. In the case of stationary time series, which is the regime we consider
in this work, it is natural to also introduce the TE rate
T X?Y = lim
??0
H(yt+? |yt)?H(yt+? |xt, yt)
?
= lim
??0
I(yt+? : yt, xt)? I(yt+? : yt)
?
, (3)
where the continuous time variable t replaces the discrete index i. In practice
T X?Y ? TX?Y /? , but only for sufficiently small time step ? .
The most direct strategy to evaluate Eq. (1) would be to construct empirical
estimators of the probabilities from histograms of the data. Although this procedure
works well for evaluating other quantities, for instance the entropy production in small
stochastic systems [12], it completely fails in the case of transfer entropy. Indeed, such
a method leads to a non-zero TE even between uncorrelated signals, due to strong
biases in standard estimators based on data binning. In order to overcome this
problem, we used the Kraskov-Sto?gbauer-Grassberger (KSG) estimator which does not
rely on binning, as implemented in the software package JIDT (Java Information
Dynamics Toolkit) [13]. Using estimators of this kind is particularly important for
variables that take continuous values.
In the following, the inference method will be applied to time series generated by
diffusion processes. It will then be interesting to compare the TE rate T X?Y to
another measure of information dynamics, the so-called information flow [14–16] (also
dubbed learning rate in the context of sensory systems [11, 17]), which is defined as
the time-shifted mutual information [18]
IflowX?Y = lim??0
I(yt : xt)? I(yt : xt+? )
?
. (4)
In the special case where the two processes X and Y experience independent noises
(the system is then called bipartite) [15], one has the inequality IflowX?Y ? TX?Y [17],
which in turn implies that
IflowX?Y ? T X?Y (5)
PLOS 3/24
when the joint process is Markovian. Observing a violation of this inequality is thus a
strong indication that the noises on X and Y are correlated. As will be seen later, this
is indeed the situation in biochemical networks, due the presence of the so-called
extrinsic noise generated by the stochasticity in the cell and in the cell
environment [19] which acts on all chemical reactions within the cell, and thus induces
correlations.
Results
Test of the inference method on a Langevin model
In order to benchmark our inference method and perform a rigorous test in a
controlled setting, we first applied it on times series generated by a simple model for
which the transfer entropy and the information flow can be computed analytically.
The data were obtained by simulating the two coupled Langevin equations
mv? = ??v ? ay + ?,
?r y? = v ? y + ? (6)
that describe the dynamics of a particle of mass m subjected to a velocity-dependent
feedback that damps thermal fluctuation [16, 20, 21] (in these equations, the
dependence of the variables on the time t is implicit). Here, ?(t) is the noise generated
by the thermal environment with viscous damping ? and temperature T , while ?(t) is
the noise associated with the measurement of the particle’s velocity v(t). The two
noises are independent and Gaussian with zero-mean and variances
??(t)?(t?)? = 2?kBT?(t? t?) and ??(t)?(t?)? = ?2?(t? t?). a is the feedback gain and ?r
is a time constant.

function of the noise intensity ?2 for k = 1 (blue circles), k = 3 (green circles) and
k = 5 (red circles). The parameter l present in the definition of Eq. (1) is fixed to 1.
The lower red (resp. upper blue) solid line represents the value of TY?V (resp. TY ?V )
obtained by multiplying the theoretical rate TY ?V (resp. T Y?V ) given by Eq. (21)
(resp. Eq. (23) by the sampling time ? = 10?3. The parameters of the model are
T = 5, ? = m = 1, ?r = 0.1, and a = 8.
The two Langevin equations were numerically integrated with the standard Heun’s
method [22] using a time step ?t = 10?3, and the transfer entropy in the steady state
was estimated from 100 time series of duration t = 2000 with a sampling time (i.e., the
time between two consecutive data points) ? = ?t. We first checked that the TE in
PLOS 4/24
the direction Y ? V does vanish in the absence of feedback, i.e. for a = 0, whereas it
is non-zero as soon as a > 0. We then tested the influence of the measurement error ?2
for a fixed value of the gain a. As can be seen in figure 1, TV?Y diverges as ?
2 ? 0, a
feature that will play an important role in our discussion of the model for the
metabolic network. In the figure, the color of the symbols correspond to three different
values of the parameter k which represents the history length in the definition of the
transfer entropy (see Eq. (1)). One can see that the estimates of TV?Y for k = 1 are
in very good agreement with the theoretical prediction for TV?Y (upper solid line).
Moreover, the estimates decrease as k is increased from 1 to 5, and one can reasonably
expect that the theoretical value of TV?Y (lower solid line) computed in Ref. [16] and
given by Eq. (21) in the section on Methods would be reached in the limit k ? ?.
Finally, by estimating the information flow and the transfer entropy, we checked
that inequality (5) holds, as a result of the independence of the two noises ? and ? (see
Fig. 5 in the section on Methods).
Analysis of stochasticity in a metabolic network
Experimental time series
We are now in position to analyze the fluctuations in the metabolism of E. coli at the
single cell level obtained in Ref. [4] using the information-theoretic notions introduced
and tested in the previous section. Since there are a multitude of reactions and
interactions involved in the metabolism of E. coli, a complete mechanistic description
is not feasible, and our model-free inference method has a crucial advantage. In
Ref. [4], the length of the cells was recorded as a function of time using image analysis,
and the growth rate was then obtained by fitting this data over subparts of the cell
cycle. In the same experiment, the fluorescence level of GFP, which is co-expressed
with growth enzymes LacY and LacZ was recorded. Three set of experiments were
carried out corresponding to three levels of an inducer IPTG: low, intermediate and
high.

Fig 2. Pedigree tree representing the evolution of the colony of E. coli. studied in
Ref. [4]. The splitting of the branches corresponds to cell division events, each colored
point is associated to a measurement of a single cell and the colors represent the
growth rates as shown in the bar in the lower part of the figure.
The two time series have a branching structure due to the various lineages, which
all start from a single mother cell as shown in Fig. 2. The experimental data thus
come in the form of a large ensemble of short times series which represent a record of
all the cell cycles. There are about ? 3000 time series, with 2 to 8 measurement points
in each of them which are represented as colored points in figure 2. In order to
correctly estimate the transfer entropy from such data, we have analyzed the multiple
time series as independent realizations of the same underlying stochastic process. For
the present analysis, we fix the history length parameters k and l to the value
PLOS 5/24
k = l = 1, which means that we focus on T rather than T . We infer the values of T in
the two directions, from growth (denoted µ) to gene expression (denoted E) and vice
versa. The results obtained for the three concentrations of IPTG are represented in
table 1. The negative value of Tµ?E which is found in the intermediate case is due to
the numerical inference method and should be regarded as a value which cannot be
distinguished from zero.
Based on this analysis, we conclude that the influence between the variables is
directed primarily from enzyme expression to growth in the low and intermediate
IPTG experiments, while it mainly proceeds in the reverse direction in the high IPTG
experiment. Such results are in line with the conclusions of Ref. [4] based on the
measured asymmetry of the time-lagged cross-correlations. Moreover, the present
analysis provides an estimate of the influence between the two variables separately in
the two directions from E to µ and from µ to E. In particular, we observe for the low
experiment that the values of TE in the two directions are of same order of magnitude,
whereas in the intermediate experiment the TE from E to µ is larger, a feature which
could not have been guessed from measured time delays.

Theoretical Models
We now turn to the analysis of the model proposed in Ref. [4] to account for the
experimental data. The question we ask is whether the model correctly reproduces the
above results for the transfer entropies, in particular the change in the sign of ?TE?µ
for the high concentration of IPTG.
The central equation of the model describes the production of the enzyme as
E? = p? µ ·E, (7)
where E is the enzyme concentration, p its production rate, and µ the rate of increase
in cell volume. Although the function p is typically non-linear, its precise expression is
irrelevant because (7) is linearized around the stationary point defined by the mean
values E = E0 and µ = µ0. This linearization then yields
?E? = ?p? ?µE0 ? µ0?E, (8)
in terms of perturbed variables ?X(t) = X(t)?X0, where X0 denotes the mean of X .
The model of Ref. [4] is essentially phenomenological in nature because it
approximates the noises as Gaussian processes. Although this approximation is often
done in this field, it may not always hold since fluctuations due to low copy numbers
are generally not Gaussian [23]. In any case, the model contains three Gaussian noises:
NG is a common component while NE and Nµ are component specific to E and µ.
These noises are assumed to be independent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noises with zero mean
PLOS 6/24
and autocorrelation functions ?Ni(t)Ni(t?)? = ?2i e??i|t?t
?| (i = E, µ,G). As commonly
done, the three Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noises are generated by the auxiliary equations
N?i = ??iNi + ?i, (9)
where the ??is are zero-mean Gaussian white noises satisfying

where specifically TEµ = ?1 and TµG = 1. Then, eliminating ?p from Eqs. (8) and
(10), one obtains the coupled equations
x? = µ0
[
(TEE ? 1)x+ TEµy + TEGNG +NE
]
y = TµEx+ TµGNG +Nµ, (11)
where we have defined the reduced variables x = ?E/E0, y = ?µ/µ0. We stress that
NG is an extrinsic noise that affects both the enzyme concentration and the growth
rate, whereas NE (resp. Nµ) is an intrinsic noise that only affects E (resp. µ). Note
that the two effective noises TEGNG +NE and TµGNG +Nµ acting on x? and y are
colored and correlated, which makes the present model more complicated than most
stochastic models studied in the current literature. In fact, since we are mainly
interested in the information exchanged between x and y, it is convenient to replace
one of the noises, say NG, by the dynamical variable y. Differentiating the second
equation in Eq. (11), using Eq. (9) and performing some simple manipulations, one
then obtains a new set of equations for the four random variables x, y, u ? NE, v ? Nµ:
x? = a1x+ a2u+ a3v + a4y
y? = b1x+ b2u+ b3v + b4y + ?y
u? = ??Eu+ ?E
v? = ??µv + ?µ , (12)
where the coefficients aj and bj (j = 1...4) are defined by Eqs. (24) in the section on
Methods and ?y = ?µ + ?G is a new white noise satisfying
??y(t)?y(t?)? = (?2µ + ?2G)?(t? t?) and ??y(t)?µ(t?)? = ?2µ?(t? t?).
The calculation of the transfer entropy rate T X?Y (which coincides with T E?µ
since the TE is invariant under the change of variables from E to x and µ to y) is
detailed in the section on Methods, together with the calculation of the information
flows. The final expression reads
T X?Y =

where p(x, y) is the steady state probability distribution and the functions g?y and g?y
are defined in Eqs. (40) and (43), respectively. This result agrees with that obtained
in Refs. [11], [18] and in [24] in special cases.
In Table 2, we show the results of the analysis of the time series generated by Eqs.
(12) using our numerical inference method with a sampling time ? = 1min (equal to
the time step ?t used to numerically integrate the model). One can see that the

estimates of T E?µ are in good agreement with the predictions of Eq. (13), with the
values of the model parameters taken from Table S1 in Ref. [4]. Note that the negative
number given by the inference method in the high IPTG experiment signals that the
actual value of T E?µ cannot be distinguished from zero, which is indeed the
theoretical prediction. In contrast, the estimated and theoretical results for T µ?E do
not agree, as the inference method yields finite values in all cases whereas the
theoretical values diverge.

Fig 3. Transfer entropy rates T E?µ and T µ?E in the low IPTG experiment: (a)
Original model of Ref. [4] (b) Modified model where NE is a white noise. The symbols
are the estimates from the inference method when varying the sampling time ? , and
the solid lines are the theoretical predictions from Eq. (13) in (a) and from Eqs. (60)
in (b). Note that T µ?E diverges as ? goes to zero in fig (a) but not (b).
This behavior is due to the absence of a white noise source directly affecting the
dynamical evolution of x in the set of Eqs. (12). Indeed, as pointed out in Ref. [6] and
also observed above in figure 1, a TE rate diverges when the coupling between the
variables is deterministic. In the model of Ref. [4], this feature can be traced back to
the fact that the noise NE affecting the enzyme concentration is colored with a finite
relaxation time ??1E . Therefore, when taking the limit ? ? 0 in Eq. (3), one explores a
time interval ? < ??1E where NE is not really random. This is illustrated in figure 3a
PLOS 8/24
that corresponds to the low IPTG experiment: we see that the estimate of T µ?E with
the inference method is indeed diverging when the sampling time ? approaches zero.
On the other hand, as expected, T E?µ remains finite and the points nicely lie on the
plateau determined by Eq. (13).
The obvious and simplest way to cure this undesirable feature of the original model
is to treat NE as a purely white noise, which amounts to taking the limit ?
?1
E ? 0. In
fact, it is noticeable that the values of ??1E extracted from the fit of the correlation
functions in Ref. [4] (resp. ??1E = 10.7, 9.9 and 8.15 min for the low, intermediate, and
high IPTG concentrations) are significantly smaller than the time steps ?exp used for
collecting the data (resp. ?exp = 28, 20 and 15.8 min). Therefore, it is clear that the
experimental data are not precise enough to decide whether NE is colored or not. This
issue does not arise for the other relaxation times in the model, ??1µ = ?
?1
G and µ
?1
0 ,
which are much longer (at least for the low and intermediate IPTG concentrations),
and can be correctly extracted from the experimental data.
We thus propose to modify the model of Ref. [4] by describing NE as a Gaussian
white noise with variance ?NE(t)NE(t?)? = 2DE?(t? t?) and the same intensity as the
colored noise in the original model, i.e. DE = ?
2
E/?E (which yields
DE ? 0.188h, 0.100h, 0.031h for the three IPTG concentrations). Unsurprisingly, this
modification does not affect the auto and cross-correlation functions used to fit the
data, as shown in Fig. 7 in the section on Methods. On the other hand, the values of
T E?µ are changed (compare Tables 2 and 3) and, more importantly, T µ?E , given by
Eq. (60) is now finite. As a result, the model predicts that the difference
?T E?µ = T E?µ ? T µ?E is positive at low and intermediate IPTG concentrations
and becomes negative at high concentration, which is in agreement with the direct
analysis of the experimental data in Table 1. In contrast, ?T E?µ was always negative
in the original model as T µ?E is infinite.

Table 3. Theoretical values of the transfer entropy rates T E?µ and T µ?E and their
difference in the modified model.
This new behavior of the TE rates is also manifest when the inference method is
applied to the time series generated by the model and the sampling time ? is varied.
As observed in Fig. 3b, the inferred value of T µ?E no longer diverges as ? ? 0
(compare the vertical scale with that in Fig. 3a). The estimates of T E?µ and T µ?E
are also in good agreement with the theoretical predictions, except for the shortest
value of ? which is equal to the time step ?t = 1 min used to numerically integrate the
equations. It worth mentioning, however, that the error bars increase as ? is decreased.
While the change in the sign of ?T E?µ is now confirmed by the model, which is
the main outcome of our analysis, one may also wonder whether the numerical values
in Table 1 are recovered. This requires to multiply the rates in Table 3 by the
experimental sampling times ?exp which are different in each experiment, as indicated
above. One then observes significant discrepancies for the low and intermediate IPTG
experiments. We believe that the problem arises from the presence of many short time
series in the set of experimental data. This is a important issue that needs to be
examined in more detail since it may be difficult to obtain long time series in practice.
To this aim, we have studied the convergence of the estimates of ?T E?µ to the
exact asymptotic value as a function of N , the length of the time series generated by
the model in the stationary regime. As shown in Fig. 4, the convergence with N is

slow, which means that one can make significant errors in the estimation of ?T E?µ if
N is small. On the other hand, the convergence can be greatly facilitated by choosing
a value of the sampling time which is not too short (but of course shorter than the
equilibration time of the system), for instance ? = 6min instead of 1 min in the case
considered in Fig. 4. The important observation is that the sign of ?T E?µ is then
correctly inferred even with N ? 1000. In contrast, with ? = 1min, this is only
possible for much longer series, typically N ? 50000. This is an encouraging indication
for experimental studies, as the overall acquisition time of the data can be significantly
reduced.
Finally, we briefly comment on the results for the information flows IflowE?µ and
Iflowµ?E . As already pointed out, the fact that the noises acting on the two random
variables are correlated invalidates inequality (5). This is indeed what is observed in
Table 5 in the section on Methods. It is also noticeable that IflowE?µ 6= ?I

Discussion and conclusion
A challenge when studying any biochemical network is to properly identify the
direction of information. In this work, using the notion of transfer entropy, we have
characterized the directed flow of information between the single cell growth rate and
the gene expression, using a method that goes beyond what could be obtained from
correlation functions, or from other inference techniques which do not exploit
dynamical information.
Another crucial challenge in the field is to properly model the various noise
components. It turns out that biological systems are generally non-bipartite due the
presence of an extrinsic component in the noise. The present work provides on the one
hand analytical expressions for the magnitude of the transfer entropy (or at least an
upper bound on it) and of the information flow when the system is not bipartite, and,
on the other hand a numerical method to infer the TE in all cases. Furthermore, we
have shown that one can correctly infer the sign of the TE difference even with short
time series by properly choosing the sampling time (see Ref. [25] for more details on
the dependence of TE on the sampling time).
To conclude, we would like to emphasize that the transfer entropy is a general tool
PLOS 10/24
to identify variables which are relevant for time series prediction [26]. As such, the
method has a lot of potential beyond the particular application covered in this paper:
Predicting the current or future state of the environment by sensing it is an
adaptation strategy followed by biological systems which can be understood using
information-theoretic concepts [11, 27]. Similarly, during evolution, biological systems
accumulate information from their environment, process it and use it quasi-optimally
to increase their own fitness [28, 29]. In this context, transfer entropy-based methods
have the potential to identify the directional interactions in co-evolution processes,
which could be for instance the genomic evolution of a virus compared to that of its
antigenes [30]. With the recent advances in high-throughput techniques and
experimental evolution, we might soon be able to predict reliably the evolution of
biological systems [31], and without doubt tools of information theory will play a key
role in these advances.
Methods
In this section, we provide a detailed analysis of the information-theoretic quantities
for the various models considered in this paper. The section is organized as follows:
• Basic information-theoretic measures
• Transfer entropy and information flow in the feedback cooling model
• Transfer entropy rates and information flows in the model of Ref. [4] for a
metabolic network
• Transfer entropy rates and information flows in the modified model for the
metabolic network
Basic information-theoretic measures
Below we briefly recall some definitions and properties of the information-theoretic
measures. A fundamental quantity is the Shannon entropy which quantifies the
uncertainty associated with the measurement x of a random variable X :
H(X) = ?
?
x
P (x) lnP (x), (14)
where P (x) is the probability that event x is realized, given an ensemble of possible
outcomes. With this convention, the entropy is measured in nats. Similarly, for two
random variables X and Y , one defines the joint Shannon entropy
H(X,Y ) = ?
?
x,y
P (x, y) lnP (x, y), (15)
and the conditional Shannon entropy
H(X |Y ) = ?
?
x,y
P (x, y) lnP (x|y) , (16)
where P (x, y) and P (x|y) are joint and conditional probability distribution functions,
respectively. The mutual information I(X : Y ) is then a symmetric measure defined as
I(X : Y ) =
?
x,y
P (x, y) ln
P (x, y)
P (x)P (y)
,
= H(X)?H(X |Y )
= H(Y )?H(Y |X) , (17)
PLOS 11/24
which quantifies the reduction of the uncertainty about X (resp. Y ) resulting from the
knowledge of the value of Y (respX). The more strongly X and Y are correlated, the
larger I(X : Y ) is.
These notions can be readily extended to random processes X = {Xi} and
Y = {Yi} viewed as collections of individual random variables sorted by an integer
time index i. The mutual information between the ordered time series {xi} and {yi},
realizations of X and Y , is then defined as
I(X : Y ) = I(Y : X) ?
?
{xi,yi}
P (xi, yi) ln
P (xi, yi)
P (xi)P (yi)
, (18)
and characterizes the undirected information exchanged between the two processes.
The conditional mutual information is defined similarly.
In contrast, the transfer entropy TX?Y is a information-theoretic measure that is
both asymmetric and dynamic as it captures the amount of information that a source
process X provides about the next state of a target process Y . More precisely, as
defined by Eq. (1) in the introduction,
TX?Y =
?
i
[I(Yi+1 :X
(l)
i ,Y
(k)
i )? I(Yi+1 : Y
(k)
i )], (19)
where k and l define the lengths of the process histories, i.e., Y
(k)
i = {Yi?k+1, · · · , Yi}
and X
(l)
i = {Xi?l+1, · · · , Xi}. In this work, we have focused on a history length of 1
(i.e. k = l = 1) and denoted the corresponding TE by TX?Y . Hence,
TX?Y =
?
i[H(Yi+1|Yi)?H(Yi+1|Xi, Yi)], which is an upper bound to TX?Y (k, l) for
l = 1 when the joint process {X,Y } obeys a Markovian dynamics [11].
On the other hand, the information flow from X to Y is defined as the time-shifted
mutual information
IflowX?Y =
?
i
[I(Yi : Xi)? I(Yi : Xi+1)], (20)
and informs on the reduction of uncertainty in Yi when knowing about Xi+1 as
compared to what we had with Xi only. In practice, IflowX?Y can be obtained by
shifting in time one time series with respect to the other one. Contrary to the transfer
entropy which is always a positive quantity, the information flow IflowX?Y may be
negative or positive, depending on whether X sends information to Y (or X gains
control of Y ), or Y sends information to X (or X looses control over Y ). In a
bipartite system one has IflowX?Y = ?I
flow
Y?X in the stationary regime. This is no longer
true when the system is non-bipartite.
Transfer entropy and information flow in the feedback cooling
model
We first recall the theoretical expressions of the transfer entropy rates and the
information flows for the feedback-cooling model described by Eqs. (6). These
quantities were computed in Ref. [16]. The transfer entropy rates in the stationary
state are given by
TV ?Y =

TY ?V =

PLOS 12/24
Note that 2T/(??2) is the signal-to-noise ratio that quantifies the relative size of the
measurement accuracy to the thermal diffusion of the velocity. Accordingly, the TE
rate TV ?Y diverges when the control is deterministic. The information flow IflowV ?Y is
given by
IflowV ?Y =
?

T ?y2?

)
(22)
where |?| is the determinant of the covariance matrix. The analytical expressions of
the elements of the matrix, ?v2?, ?y2? and ?vy?, are given by Eqs. (A2) in Ref. [16]. In
contrast with TV ?Y , the information flow IflowV?Y remains finite as the noise intensity
vanishes.

The upper bounds to the transfer entropies (see Eq. (2)) were computed in
Ref. [24] in the general case of coupled linear Langevin equations. For the feedback
cooling model, one obtains

As shown in Figure 1, the estimate of the information flow obtained by the
inference method is in good agreement with the theoretical value (we stress that the
figure shows the rates multiplied by the sampling time ? = 10?3). Moreover, it can be
seen that the inequalities IflowV?Y ? TV?Y ? T V ?Y are satisfied.

interval [0, t]. Since the present model is not bipartite, the calculation of these

A similar expression can be found in Ref. [11] (see Eq. (A.31) in that reference). Note
also that the result given in Ref. [24] is obtained as a special case.
Inserting into Eq. (13) the values of the parameters given in Table S1 of Ref. [4],
we obtain the values given in Table 2. Note that T E?µ = 0 for the high IPTG
concentration because TµE = 0, and therefore µ(t) no longer depends on E(t) as can
be seen from Eq. (10).
There is no need to detail the calculation of T µ?E (i.e. T Y ?X) because it goes
along the same line, with y replaced by x. The crucial difference is that there is no
white noise acting on x?. Therefore, the denominator in Eq. (13), which is the variance
of the noise ?y, is replaced by 0. This implies that T µ?E is infinite.
Information flows
The information flows IflowX?Y and I
flow
Y?X are derived from the time-shifted mutual
informations I[xt+? : yt] and I[yt+? : xt]. Specifically,
IflowX?Y = lim
??0
I[xt : yt]? I[xt+? : yt]
?
IflowY ?X = lim??0
I[yt : xt]? I[yt+? : xt]
?
. (51)
Let us first consider the second flow IflowY?X which requires the knowledge of
pyx?(y, t+ ? ;x
?, t) whose expression is obtained by integrating Eq. (39) over x?. This
yields
pyx?(y, t+ ? ;x

We finally obtain
IflowY?X =

is an averaged drift coefficient. Contrary to the case of the transfer entropy rate
T Y ?X , the absence of a white noise acting on x? does not lead to an infinite result for
IflowY ?X . In fact, one has the symmetry relation
IflowX?Y = ?I
flow
Y?X , (57)
which is readily obtained by noting that pxy(x, y), the stationary solution of the
Fokker-Planck equation, satisfies the equation

Inserting the numerical values of the parameters given in Table S1 of Ref. [4], we
obtain the values given in Table 4 below. Interestingly, IflowE?µ decreases as the IPTG
concentration increases and that it becomes negative at high concentration.

Transfer entropy rates and information flows in the modified
model for the metabolic network
We now repeat the above calculations for the modified model where NE is treated as a
white noise. Eliminating again the variable w (i.e. NG) in favor of y, the new set of

equations that describe the stochastic dynamics and replace Eqs. 12 reads

where we have defined the white noises ?x = µ0NE and ??y = ?y + TµE?x satisfying
??x(t)?x(t?)? = 2DEµ20?(t? t?) and ???y(t)??y(t?)? = (?2µ + ?2G + 2DEµ20T 2µE)?(t? t?),
respectively. These two noises are correlated, with ??x(t)??y(t?)? = 2DEµ20TµE?(t? t?).
The pdfs and the correlation functions can be computed as before. In fact, it is
clear that this simply amounts to taking the limit ?E ? ? with DE = ?2E/?E finite in
the previous equations (for instance in Eqs. (27) for the covariances). The new
correlation functions are plotted in Fig. 7. As expected, they are almost
indistinguishable from those obtained with the original model and they fit the
experimental data just as well (this of course is also true for the pdfs).
Much more interesting are the results for the transfer entropy rates and the
information flows. Again, there is no need to repeat the calculations as they follow the
same lines as before. We now obtain

Table 5. Comparison between the theoretical values of the TE rates and the
information flows for the modified model and the values inferred from simulation data
(all quantities are expressed in h?1). The analysis was performed with a sampling
? = 6 min and 100 time series of 106 points.
The numerical values of T E?µ and T µ?E are given in Table 3. For completeness,
we also compare these values with the estimates obtained by the inference method in
Table 5 below. We see that satisfactory results are obtained by properly choosing the
sampling time ? . This is also true for the information flows IflowE?µ and I
flow
µ?E . It is
worth noting that the symmetry relation I?flowE?µ = ?I?
flow
µ?E no longer holds, except for
the high IPTG concentration (as TµE = 0). This contrasts with the preceding case
where NE was modeled by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise. We also observe that the
information flows are not always smaller than the transfer entropy rates, contrary to
what occurs in bipartite systems. Therefore, the concept of a “sensory capacity”
introduced in Ref. [11] is here ineffective.
