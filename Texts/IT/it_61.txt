Abstract—We propose a new one-bit feedback scheme with
scheduling decision based on the maximum expected weighted
rate. We show the concavity of the 2-user case and provide the
optimal solution which achieves the maximum weighted rate of
the users. For the general asymmetric M -user case, we provide
a heuristic method to achieve the maximum expected weighted
rate. We show that the sum rate of our proposed scheme is very
close to the sum rate of the full channel state information case,
which is the upper bound performance.
Index Terms—Diversity, feedback, multiuser, scheduling.
I. INTRODUCTION
Temporal and spectral fluctuations are fundamental charac-
teristics of the wireless channel, which occur due to physical
phenomena such as fading and shadowing [1]. Consequently,
channel-aware adaptive transmission techniques [2] and dy-
namic resource allocation, using opportunistic scheduling,
are applied practically in modern communication systems to
maintain good performance under this dynamic environment.
The underlying objective of these schemes is exploiting the
fading wireless channels when they are at their peak conditions
to achieve significant capacity gains [3], [4]. Explicit training
sequences (i.e., pilot signals) are used in current wireless
communication systems to enable the receivers to measure the
instantaneous channel conditions so that coherent detection of
the transmitted signals can be applied [5]. In opportunistic
scheduling schemes, channel state information (CSI) of all
back-logged mobile users in the network should be known at
the central scheduler, i.e. base-station. The mobile terminals
inform the central scheduler about their CSI using explicit
feedback messages. The main drawback is that the CSI feed-
back consumes a considerable portion of the total air-link re-
sources. Moreover, with the consideration of massive multiple-
input multiple-output (MIMO) as an enabling technology for
5G networks, the associated pilot contamination problem rises
as a performance limiter [6]–[8]. Consequently, there is a need
to develop new transmission technologies with reduced CSI
feedback from the users to the base-station. This comes at an
advantage to network operators who can release the bandwidth
resources that are reserved for CSI feedback to be used for
supporting more user data traffic.
The main technical challenge in the design of a reduced-
feedback multi-user scheduling scheme is maintaining the
prospected capacity gain due to multi-user diversity. This is an
important research topic that is seldom investigated thoroughly
in the literature [9]. Extensive surveys on feedback reduction
methods are provided in [9]. The switched-diversity multi-
user scheduling schemes are considered as reduced-feedback
schemes [10]–[12]. These schemes are based on one-bit feed-
back per user per CSI with pre-determined priority order of the
users. The CSI feedback is controlled by a threshold on the
channel condition to decide the one-bit feedback to be sent
to the base-station. The optimization of the users feedback
thresholds depends on their assigned priority order.
In this letter, we propose a new approach to the one-bit feed-
back problem in which the users scheduling is based on the
maximum expected reward, i.e., the weighted rate, conditional
on the one-bit feedback sent from all users. We optimize the
feedback thresholds of each user for this scheme and show that
the performance of this limited-feedback scenario is not far
from the full-CSI feedback case. We provide analytic solutions
for the 2-user case. For the general case of M asymmetric
users, we provide a heuristic method to achieve the maximum
expected weighted rate.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a broadcast channel with a single base-station
and M users. We assume a block-fading channel model where
the channels remain unchanged during the coherence time and
changes from one coherence time duration to another. The
channels are independent from one link to another. The source
is not aware of the CSI over each individual channel block.
However, it knows the statistical information of the channels
of all users, which is presented by the probability density
function (PDF) of the achievable rate ri, denoted by fi(r) for
the channel of user i. A one-bit feedback signal from each user
per channel block is used to aid the base-station in selecting
which one of the users will be scheduled in a given channel
block. The one-bit feedback of a user indicates if its channel
in a given channel block is above or below a predetermined
threshold of the achievable rate, denoted by ri.
The objective of the scheduling task is to select the user
with the highest weighted rate, where the weight of a user,
denoted by µi for user i, is predetermined before the actual
operation (based on quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for
each user) and hence is not subject to optimization. Since
the source does not have exact knowledge of the CSI of all
users, it incorporates its knowledge of the PDFs of the users’
channels and the received one-bit feedback from each user in
the scheduling decision. Therefore, in every channel block,
the base-station schedules the user with the highest weighted
expected achievable rate conditioned on the received feedback
information from that user, µiE[Ri(k)|b1, b2, . . . , bm], where
E[·] denotes the expected value of the argument, Ri(k) denotes
the achievable rate of user i during the channel block k, and
bi is the one-bit feedback from user i. For the rest of the letter,
the time index k is omitted for simplicity.
A. Optimization Problem
We optimize the feedback thresholds of the users to maxi-
mize the weighted-sum rates of the users, denoted ?
? =

where R?i is the expected rate of each user (i.e., averaged
across channel blocks). Therefore, we can write the main

Let us define two quantities for each user, R+i = E[Ri|Ri >

where Fi(r) is the cumulative density function (CDF) of the
achievable rate of the channel of user i.
Moreover, we need to define two quantities to study the
effect of the feedback of one user on the scheduling probability
of another user, ?+ij = Pr{µiRi > µjRj |Ri > ri} and
??ij = Pr{µiRi > µjRj |Ri < ri}, where i 6= j. These can
be obtained using

III. OPTIMIZED THRESHOLDS
In this section, we will investigate the problem of finding
the optimum thresholds of each user. We start with the 2-user
case. Then, we extend the analysis to the general M -user case.
A. 2-User System
Based on the construction of the system, and the structure
of (4), we will find that we have 6 different formats of ?,
each of them represents a different combination of the values
of (5). Figure 1 illustrates the effect of the selection of the
thresholds on the weighted of the expected rates of the users
?, we can notice that the system has 2 different peaks. Hence,
this problem is a non-convex problem.
Consider the case µ1R
+
1 > µ2R
+
2 . This will limit the
number of available formats of ? into 3, which are shown
in (7). Also, we can rewrite (7c) into (8) and (9).
Proposition 1: A local peak for the value of ? can be found
in the region where the selected thresholds meet one of the
following conditions
µ1R
+
1 > µ2R
+
2 > µ1R
?
1 > µ2R
?
2 , (6a)
µ2R
+
2 > µ1R
+
1 > µ2R
?
2 > µ1R
?
1 . (6b)
Proof: From (8), it is shown that (7c) is always larger than
(7a), as the value of (µ2R
+
2 ? µ1R?1 ) is always positive. The
is also true for (9) and (7b), where (µ1R
?
1 ?µ2R?2 ) is always
positive. Similarly, we can show that case of (µ1R
+
1 < µ2R
+
2 )
provides the same results.
Based on Proposition 1, the search for the optimum thresh-
olds has been limited into 2 regions instead of 6.
Proposition 2: The optimum thresholds for condition (6a)
are given by
r?1 =
µ2
µ1
R+2 , r
?
2 =
µ1
µ2
R?1 (10)
and similarly for the case of (6b),
r?1 =
µ2
µ1
R?2 , r
?
2 =
µ1
µ2
R+1 . (11)
Proof: See Appendix A.
B. M -User System
In the M -user case, the exact solution of the optimization
problem for finding the global peak is not feasible. Hence, we
provide a heuristic method to find the solution. Back to the
definition of the function in (4), the number of possible formats
as a function of the number of users is 3M !. Following the
same criteria of the 2-user case, we can extend the condition
in (6) to
µ1R
+
1 >µ2R
+
2 > · · ·>µMR+M >µ1R?1 >µ2R?2 >. . .>µMR?M .
(12)
Hence, the number of the local peaks would be M !. In general,
for any number of users M , the formula of the rate based on
the condition in (12) is given by
R?1 = R
+
1 [1? F1 (r1)] +R?1

k=1
Fk (rk) ,
R?i = R

This can be reformulated into M ! different formulas as

(15)
where F0(r0) = 1, µ0 = 0, and m = 1, 2, . . . ,M !. Each of
these formulas represents a region of thresholds where a local
peak exist. To find the optimum thresholds, we equate the first
derivative of ? with respect to r to zero. That is,
??m
?r?i
= 0, (16)
and based on (13), we will find that optimum thresholds will
take the following values:

It is noticeable that the values of the thresholds recursively
depend on each other. Hence, we will have to find their values
numerically using numerical methods such as the Bi-section
algorithm. In our case, the Bi-section algorithm is used to
calculate the optimum thresholds. This algorithm obtains the
optimum thresholds for one of the multiple local-optimas. The
selection of that local-optima can be realized using one of the
following approaches.
1) Brute-Force Search: For this case, for each of the M !
regions, the optimum thresholds should be calculated, and
compare the values of ? to get the maximum value. Such
approach will require the recursive process for calculating the
thresholds to be repeated M ! times.
2) Threshold-Independent Function: Another approach is
to find a certain function gi(µi, fi(r)) which is independent
of the thresholds. Using this way, we will have only M
calculations for the value of the function gi, then order the
users based on the corresponding value, and finally calculate
the optimum thresholds only once.
3) Random Selection: An alternative approach is to ran-
domly select one of the M ! regions, calculate the optimum
thresholds, and decide based on these thresholds. This ap-
proach will have minimal calculations requirements, and we
will show that it has a negligible performance loss.

variance. We assume that µ1 = 1.1, µ2 = 1.05, µ3 = 1, µ4 =
0.95, and µ5 = 0.9. In Fig. 2 shows that the average weighted
rate of our proposed one-bit feedback system is comparable
with the full-CSI case (upper bound performance).
Fig. 3 shows the change of the thresholds and average
rate for each user. We can notice that the rates are close to
each other in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels, and
the gaps between them become wider as the SNR increases.
It is noticeable that the QoS requirements affect the way
the sum rate is maximized. Users with higher priorities are
allocated more frequently which gives them higher rate at
better channel condition. On the other hand, users with lower
priorities maintain the same rate regardless of the channel
condition.
In Fig. 4, we compare the average weighted rate based
on the peak selection method. The comparison is between
the random selection of any peak and the maximum peak
selection. We can find that randomly selecting any local peak,
has a negligible effect on the system performance. which
can be a good choice to avoid the complexity of finding the
global peak.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We showed that the optimum thresholds are recursively
dependent. Hence, Bi-section method can be used to obtain
their values. The results showed that the weighted rate of
our optimized limited feedback system is very close to the
one in the case of full-CSI knowledge. We showed that
randomly-selecting one of the local maximas, which reduces
the complexity of the system, does not have a notable rate
loss. The sum-rate loss is less than 2%.
APPENDIX A
OPTIMAL THRESHOLD FOR 2-USER CASE
To find the optimum thresholds for the 2-user case, we solve
the following constrained optimization problem:

The maximum of ? is obtained using (6) under the constraint
that µ2R
?
2 < µ1R
?
1 < µ2R
+
2 < µ1R
+
1 . The optimization
problem can be then stated as follows:
max .
ri

0
rf1(r)dr +
[
µ2R
+
2 ? µ1R?1
]
F1(r1) [1? F2(r2)] ,
s.t. 0 ? ri?i ? {1, 2}, µ2R?2 < µ1R?1 < µ2R+2 < µ1R+1 .
(19)
This can be rewritten as
max .
ri

rf2 (r) dr?µ1 [1?F2(r2)]
? r1

rf1 (r) dr
]
,
s.t. 0 ? ri?i ? {1, 2}, µ2R?2 < µ1R?1 < µ2R+2 ? µ1R+1 .
(20)
For a fixed (given) r2, the optimization problem is given by
max .
ri
[
K2F1(r1)?K1
? r1

rf1 (r) dr
]
,
s.t. 0 ? ri ? 1?i ? {1, 2}, µ2R?2 < µ1R?1 < µ2R+2 < µ1R+1 .
(21)
The first derivative is given by
??
?r1
= (K2?K1r1)f1 (r1) (22)
where K2 = µ2
??
r2
rf2 (r) dr and K1 = µ1F2(r2).1 If
r1 > K2/K1, the derivative is negative; hence, the objective
function is monotonically decreasing with r1. This means that
the optimal solution for a fixed r2 is attained when we set
r1 to its lowest feasible value. This value is obtained from
the constraint µ2R
?
2 < µ1R
?
1 < µ2R
+
2 . If r1 < K2/K1,
the derivative is positive; hence, the objective function is
monotonically increasing with r1. This means that the optimal
solution for a fixed r2 is attained when we set r1 to its highest
feasible value. This value is obtained from the constraint,
µ2R
?
2 < µ1R
?
1 < µ2R
+
2 .
The second derivative is given by
?2?
?r21
=?K1f1 (r1)+(K2?K1r1)?f1 (r1)
?r1
. (23)
If (K2 ?K1r1) ?f1(r1)?r1 ? 0, then the objective function is
concave. Setting the first derivative to zero, we get r?1 =
K2/K1. This condition maintains the concavity of the problem
and it is the optimal solution if and only if it satisfies the
constraints. We note that µ2
??
r2
rf2 (r) dr ? µ2r2F2(r2);
hence, r?1 = K2/K1 = µ2
??
r2
rf2 (r) dr/µ1F2(r2) >
1Throughout this letter, X = 1? X .
(µ2r2F2(r2))/(µ1F2(r2)) = (r2µ2)/µ1. To sum up, r?1 >
(µ2r2)/µ1.
In that case, we can convert the constraint from (6) into
three constraints. That is,
µ2R
+
2 ?µ1R?1 >0 ? (µ2R+2 ?µ1R?1 )F1(r1) [1?F2(r2)]>0,
µ1R
?
1 > µ2R
?
2 , µ1R
+
1 > µ2R
+
2 .
(24)
Next, we check whether or not the optimal solution satisfies
the three constraints. Using the constraint, the second term of
the objective function is positive and can be bounded as
K2F1(r1)?K1
? r1
0
rf1 (r) dr
? ?? ?
<r1F1(r1)
> (K2?K1r1)F1(r1) ? 0.
(25)
Thus, we have r1 = K2/K1. Hence, the root of the first
derivative satisfies the constraint. The second constraint can
be rewritten as
?2=µ1F2(r2)
? r1
0
rf1 (r) dr?µ2F1(r1)
? r2
0
rf2 (r) dr>0. (26)
We prove this part by contradiction. Assume that we have
µ1r
?
1 ? µ2r2 and the constraint is not satisfied. Then,
µ1F2(r2)
? r1
0
rf1 (r) dr?µ2F1(r1)
? r2
0
rf2 (r) dr<µ2F1(r1)r2F2(r2).
(27)
Since µ1F2(r2)
? r1
0 rf1 (r) dr < µ1F2(r2)r1F1(r1),
µ1F2(r2)r1F1(r1) < µ2F1(r1)r2F2(r2) ? µ1r1 < µ2r2. (28)
This contradicts the first condition, i.e., µ1r1 > µ2r2; hence,
for the second constraint to be satisfied (to be greater than
zero), r1 must equal to r?1 . The third constraint can be shown
to be satisfied using the same steps.
