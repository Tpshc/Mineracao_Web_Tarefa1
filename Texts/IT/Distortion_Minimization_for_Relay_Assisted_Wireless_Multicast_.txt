Distortion Minimization for Relay Assisted Wireless
Multicast
Zhi Chen, Pin-Han Ho, and Limei Peng
Abstract—The paper studies the scenario of wireless multicast
with a single transmitter and a relay that deliver scalable source
symbols to the receivers in a decode-and-forward (DF) fashion.
With the end-to-end mean square error distortion (EED) as
performance metric, we firstly derive the EED expression for
the L-resolution scalable source symbol for any receiver. An
optimization problem in minimizing the weighted EED is then
formulated for finding the power allocations for all resolution
layers at the transmitter and the relay. Due to nonlinearity of
the formulations, we solve the formulated optimization problems
using a generalized programming algorithm for obtaining good
sub-optimal solutions. Case studies are conducted to verify the
proposed formulations and solution approaches. The results
demonstrate the advantages of the proposed strategies in the
relay-assisted wireless networks for scalable source multicast.

I. INTRODUCTION
Wireless communication suffers from multipath fading and
the time-varying characteristic, which causes distortion to
the delivered information. To resolve this problem, joint
source-channel coding (JSCC) is shown promising in practical
wireless communication systems. JSCC pairs scalable source
coding (SSC) and superposition channel coding (SPC) by
mapping the source symbols to multiple successively refined
channel symbols. The source from a common source coding
block is scalably encoded into several resolutions/layers and
then mapped into successively refined source symbols at
the transmitter. These source symbols are then mapped into
channel symbols and superimposed into one JSCC symbol
under SPC for transmission. Employing successive interfer-
ence cancelation (SIC), each receiver can then recover up to
a specific layer of JSCC symbols with respect to its channel
quality [1]-[4].
In [1], the expected distortion of transmission of a Gaussian
source over a slow fading channel with only a finite number of
fading states is investigated. In [2], the problem of transmitting
a Gaussian source on a slowly fading Gaussian channel is
studied, subject to the mean squared error distortion measure.
[3] finds new tight finite block-length bounds for the best
achievable lossy joint source-channel code rate. In [4], reliable
transmission of a discrete memoryless source to multiple
destinations over a relay network is considered, where the

relays and the destinations all have access to side information
correlated with the underlying source signal.
Numerous efforts have been claimed on multi-resolution
SPC over wireless transmissions [5]-[11]. In [5], bit allocation
for a joint source/channel video codec over static channels is
studied, and the expected distortion is minimized through the
distribution of the available bits among the subbands. In [6],
the optimal selection of the JSCC rates through all layers over
Rayleigh fading channels is presented in terms of the overall
distortion. The energy efficiency of various JSCC problems is
studied in [7]. In addition, the JSCC problem of using hybrid
digital analog codes in transmitting a Gaussian source over a
Gaussian channel is studied in [8]. [9] presents a distributed
JSCC system for relay systems exploiting spatial and temporal
correlations. In [10], an optimal noise channel quantization
with random index assignment in a single-layer tandem source
channel coding system with one-level resolution is investi-
gated. In [11], the SPC transmission for scalable sources of
only two information layers over relay channels is investi-
gated, and the performance improvement is evaluated. [12]
presents an optimal JSCC broadcasting scheme by providing
different QoS metrics for heterogeneous users in the network
by employing fountain codes. In [13], a JSCC model over the
MIMO broadcast channel is presented to minimize the sum
mean square error distortion, where the perfect channel state
information (CSI) is assumed to be available at the transmitter
and at the receivers. [14] investigates the average throughput
and distortion of a multi-relay aided unicast system with two-
layer resolution sources, where the direct link is assumed to
be unavailable.
It is clear that most existing works on JSCC have focused on
theoretical performance such as channel capacity, outage prob-
ability and distortion exponent, which may nonetheless fail to
faithfully reflect the end-to-end (E2E) service quality in terms
of symbol error rates. Further, those theoretical performance
metrics are only suitable as metrics under high signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) regime, which however are not suitable under low
SNR regime with high channel error probabilities.
In this paper, we are committed in a new research initiative
on the resource allocation problems for multicasting of JSCC
symbols, where the transmit power of each resolution layer at
both transmitter and relay are jointly determined. The aim is
to minimize the weighted averaged EED of all users.
The contributions of this work are summarized as follows,
• introduce a general framework of JSCC transmission for
successively refined information source with an arbitrary
number of layers over relay networks.
• formulate an optimization problem for jointly determin-

II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
As shown in Fig. 1, a relay-aided multicast network consists
of one source node, one relay and N destination nodes.
The general encoding/decoding structure of a JSCC system
is shown in Fig. 2. The discrete-time, real-valued continuous
Gaussian information source at the source node is scalably
encoded and mapped into successively refined symbols of
L layers, and is broadcasted via both the direct (s ? dn,
n = 1, . . . , N ) links and the relayed (s ? r and r ? dn)
links to enable the multi-resolution information reconstruction
at the destination nodes. The L layers mapped by the scalable
information source are correspondingly denoted by the base
layer, the first enhancement layer, . . ., and the (L ? 1)th
enhancement layer, respectively. Among them, the base layer
alone provides the lowest resolution reconstruction. By adding
more enhancement layers incorporating with the base layer
gradually improves the resolution reconstruction to a higher
level, while adding the base layer and all L? 1 enhancement
layers altogether provide the highest resolution reconstruction.
Before transmission, each source symbol corresponding to
each layer is mapped into one or a set of channel symbols and
the channel symbols of all the symbols of L layers are further
superimposed under SPC. For reference, a typical example
showing the procedure of SPC constellation of the symbols of
each layer for a two-layer case is shown in Fig. 3. Further,
for readability, the definitions of some parameters used in this
work are listed in Table. I.
Let the average transmit power constraint at the source node
and the relay node be denoted by Ps and Pr. In addition, the
actual transmit power at source and relay are denoted by Ps
and Pr, respectively. For the power assigned to each layer,
it is assumed that ?
(i)
1 Pi (i = s, r) is allocated to the base
layer at node i, and ?
(i)
l Pi (l = 2, . . . , L) is allocated to the
(l?1)th enhancement layer, where ?
(i)
L = 1?
?L?1
l=1 ?
(i)
l ? 0
is for the (L ? 1)th enhancement layer and it is physically
required that ?
(i)
l ? 0 (?i, l). The power allocation vector at
node i is also referred to as ?(i) = {?
(i)
l |l = 1, · · · , L} for
simplicity. Note that both the vector representation and the
scalar representation of the power assignment parameter will
be used interchangeably in the following analysis.
The general encoding/decoding structure of a JSCC system
is shown in Fig. 2. In the first time subslot, the source node
broadcasts the JSCC symbols to the relay node and all the
receivers. In the second time subslot, the source node keeps
silent and the relay node broadcasts its decoded and re-
encoded SPC symbols to all destination nodes, possibly with
a different power allocation (?
(r)
l ) for different layer symbols.
When a JSCC symbol is received (either at the relay or
the destination), it is firstly decoded as if it just contains the
base layer symbol while taking all the other layer energy
as interference. Once the base layer is correctly obtained,
it is subtracted from the JSCC symbol, resulting in a new
JSCC symbol, which is in turn decoded as if it is just for
the first enhancement layer symbol while taking all the other
layer energy as interference. Such an iterative and successive
decoding process, also known as successive interference can-
celation (SIC), proceeds up to the L-th layer, which is defined
according to the instantaneous channel quality perceived at the
receiver.
Further, it should be noted that, at the end of the first
time subslot, the received messages of each layer at relay
from the source transmitter is fed into the cyclic redundancy

code (CRC) module for error detection and messages of the
successfully decoded layers are re-encoded and superimposed
for transmission to the destinations at the second subslot. It is
also noted that CRC is performed at the layer level for higher
system performance.
At the end of the second time subslot, the received in-
formation from both the direct and relay links, respectively,
is fed into the cyclic redundancy code (CRC) module for
error detection and then processed by the symbol selector to
determine the reconstructed bits of the channel use.
With the above mentioned SIC decoding process, a number
of L + 1 events with different probabilities can be defined
according to the instantaneous channel capacity, where the first
event denotes the loss of all information layers, the second
event denotes only the base layer is successfully obtained, and
the lth (2 < l ? L+ 1) event denotes that the base layer and
enhancement layers 1, . . . , l ? 2 are successfully obtained.
III. SYSTEM MODEL
In this section, we provide an end-to-end distortion (EED)
model for an L-layer JSCC relay-aided multicast network.
A. Channel Model
Consider a Nakagami-? fading channel where m is the
Nakagami parameter representing the severity of the channel
fading fluctuations, which degrades to the special Rayleigh
fading model with ? = 1. Further, it is assumed that he channel
gains of all links remain unchanged within one slot (where one
slot consists of two equally divided sub-slots for the direct
transmission and relayed transmission, respectively) and are
independent from each other in different slots for different
links. In addition, it is assumed that each transmitter only has
the statistics of the channel state information (CSI).
The probability density function (pdf) fh(hij) and the cu-
mulative density function (cdf) Fh(hij) of the channel power
gain over link i ? j (i = s, r and j = r, d1, . . . , dN ), are
given by,
fh(hij) = (
?
h?ij
)?

Fh(hij) =
?(?, ?
h?ij

?(?)
=

?(?)
(2)
where ?(·, ·) and ?(·, ·) are the lower and upper incomplete
Gamma functions, respectively. hij and h?ij are the instanta-
neous channel power gain and its average value, respectively.
In addition, we have h?ij = 1/d
?
ij accounting for the large-
scale fading, where ? is the pass-loss exponent and dij is the
distance between node i and j. Hence the average receiver-
side power level is ??ij = Pih?ij where Pi (i = s, r) is the
transmit power at the transmitter i. In addition, we denote
N0/2 as the two-sided power spectral density of the additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN).
In the following, with the assumption that the power al-
located to each layer is specified and the channel gains are
known, the E2E SER of up to layer l at the end of the second
slot at dn, denoted by p
(l)
err,dn
, is hence given by,

(l)

))
, (3)
4
where p
(l)
ij is the SER of the lth layer infomation over link i-
j. Note that the product in (3) follows from the independence
of transmission of different links and the terms in the outer
bracket denotes the SER probability that at least one of the
s ? r and r ? dn links fails to provide decodable version
of up to layer l in relayed transmission given the realized
channels. For reference, the detailed derivation of E2E SER
of (3) as well as that of p
(l)
ij is presented in Appendix C and
are omitted here for brevity.
B. Proposed EED model
With the allocated power for each layer at the source and
relay as well as the instantaneous channel qualities over link
i ? j, the reconstruction quality (RQ) at receiver j for this
transmission can be divided into L + 1 categories (referring
to decoding quality of the L layer symbol), namely L
(0)
ij , L
(1)
ij ,
. . . and L
(L)
ij , where L
(L)
ij represents the case that all layer
information are corrected decoded and the symbol is perfectly
reconstructed at node j. L
(0)
ij defines the case that all layer
information is lost in this transmission over link i ? j. In
addition, L
(l)
ij (0 < l ? L) indicates the case that only the
lower l layers are decoded for this transmission, including the
base layer and the l ? 1 lower enhancement layers.
Taking both the direct and relay links for a specific des-
tination node, i.e., dn into account, L
(l)
dn
is defined as the
category in which only l lower layers can be successfully
decoded at dn. Clearly, in category L
(0)
dn
, the s ? dn link
and at least one of s ? r link and r ? dn link are not able
to support even the delivery of the base layer information and
the source information is totally lost at destination node dn.
In category L
(l)
dn
(0 < l < L), only the base layer and up to
the (l ? 1)th enhancement layer can be successfully obtained
at the destination node dn through either the direct or the
relayed links. In category L
(L)
dn
, all layered source symbols are
successfully reconstructed at the destination node dn. Given
the channel realizations, the associated realization probabilities
of such events at destination node dn are therefore given by,
p

(6)
where in (5) the difference between the E2E SER of up to
layer l + 1 and l is the realization probability of successfully
decoding only up to layer l.
C. EED Evaluation
In [10] and [11], the EED expressions for one-level and
two-level resolution cases are derived, respectively. The non-
asymptotic EED expression for the realized channel gains
of all links under generally L layers can be derived in a
similar way, which is given in Appendix C. The associated
EED expression given the instantaneous channel gains that
can reconstruct the information source at destination node dn,
denoted by EEDdn , can hence be given by

where ?2 in this case is the variance of the Gaussian source
signal and DQl denotes the quantization distortion in the
reconstruction of the scalable source up to layer l.
By considering a real-valued Gaussian source with unit-
variance, its distortion exponent is denoted by the R-D func-
tion DRQ = 2
?2R, where R is the number of bits of each
symbol. Therefore, combining it with (7) together leads to (8)

where Rl is the number of bits allocated to the ith layer per
symbol under the L-layer JSCC architecture. For instance,
if the base layer employs BPSK, we have R1 = 1 bit for
each symbol, i.e., the base layer contains 1 bit information
per symbol superimposed with other upper layer symbols.
By averaging the EED expressions over the channel real-
izations of all associated links (S-R,S-dn,R-dn), the expected
EED at destination node dn is given by,
EEDdn =
???
hsdn ,hsr,hrdn
EEDdn(hsdn , hsr, hrdn)fh(hsdn)
fh(hrdn)fh(hsr) dhsdn dhsr dhrdn (9)
Interestingly, an inequality can be derived from the EED
expressions in (8) and (9) as follows.

where the lower bound holds true when all L layers are
successfully decoded and the upper bound holds true when
all L layers are lost.
IV. FORMULATION FOR EED MINIMIZATION
We take the target function as for minimizing the weighted
sum of EEDs of all source-destination pairs. The optimization
problem, termed as Popt, is then formulated as follows.

N

subject to
?(i) ? 0, i = s, r (13)
1
T?(i) ? 1, i = s, r (14)
0 ? Pi ? Pi, i = s, r (15)
where in (12) the averaged EED of each user is from (9) by
taking the expected value of EED in (8) over all realizations
of the associated links. cn is the predefined weight for the nth
user and we have 0 ? cn ? 1 and
?
cn = 1. (13) gives the
natural non-negative property of the feasible power allocation
vectors and (14) serves as the normalization constraint for the
power allocation vectors. (15) gives the average transmit power
constraint, where Pi is the transmit power at node i (i = s, r)
and should be constrained. It can be readily found that the
optimal solution is achieved when Pi = Pi and we can simply
replace Pi with Pi under a numerical method.
Note that Popt is a non-convex optimization problem and
the global optimal solution is difficult to be solved. Henceforth,
the Lagrangian dual method is employed to find the solution
to the dual problem of Popt, which serves as a very good
lower bound to Popt.
Let ?(i) (i = s, r) be the dual variables of Popt associated
with the physical normalization constraint of the power alloca-
tion vectors in (14), respectively. The Lagrangian of problem
P1 can then be expressed as,
LP1(?(i), ?(i)) =

(16)
subject to ?(i) > 0. The associated Lagrangian dual function
of LP1(?(i), ?(i)) in (16) is defined as,
gP1(?(i)) = min

Let p? and d? be the optimal solutions to the primal problem
Popt and the associated dual problem Popt-D. According to
the weak duality property in [23], we have p? ? d?, i.e., d?
serves as a good lower bound to p? of Popt. In fact, d? is equal
to the optimal solution of the convexified primal problem of
P1 , i.e., p??, which is defined as follows [24],
p?? = min{p : (0, p) ? C} (19)
where C is the convex hull of the feasible region I , defined
as,
I ={(s, z)| ??(i) ? 0 for which s ?

)
and z ?

Note that any pair (0, p) ? I is a feasible solution point
for Popt and any pair (0, p) ? C is a feasible point for the
convexified primal problem.
To solve the Lagrangian dual problem Popt-D, the gener-
alized programming algorithm in [24] by Freund is employed
and is presented as follows.

as the constraints in (13) and (14) are satisfied. In Step 2) the

In addition, due to the linear duality theory, we have zk = ?k.
On the other hand, since sk and zk are convex combinations
of the objective function and the constraint function in (12)
and (14), respectively, we immediately arrive at (sk, zk) ? C
and hence zk ? p?
? by definition of p?? for convexification of
the primal problem Popt.
For convergence, it is also observed that {z1, · · · , zk} and
{?1, · · · ,?k} are non-increasing sequences (follows from
that DLP k+1 has one more constraint than DLP k) and will
converge at a certain optimal value at p?? (zk is bounded below
by zero according to the inequality of EED in (10)).
Further, in Step 3) the dual function can be readily solved
as the constraint in (14) is relaxed, and searching the points
in the feasible domain of the non-negative L-dimensional
vector space RL?0 (a closed convex domain) can be readily
implemented. For the convergence property of the sequence
{?
(i)
k }, below it will be shown that {?
(i)
k } is a bounded
sequence. Combining Step 3) with Step 2), by selecting an
initial point ?
(i)
1 satisfying 1
T?
(i)
1 < 1 in the initialization
step, it is observed from (26) that, all elements of the dual
variable sequence {?
(i)

Taking into account the fact that ?

that 1T?

for all ?

of ?

Combining the analysis above with the duality theory in
[24] that d? = p?? (p?? is the solution to the convexified primal
problem), we hence arrive at [24]

Geometrically, the generalized programming can be taken
as inner convexification task for the primal problem and
outer convexification for the dual problem. While solving d?,
i.e., the optimal solution to the dual problem Popt-D, via
the generalized programming algorithm, the obtained solution
to Popt is hence given by
?N
n=1 EEDdn
(
?
(i)

)
with the
fulfilled stopping criterion.
Note also that we are not able to analytically discuss
how fast the generalized programming converges, however,
in the case studies, we find tens of iterations are sufficient
to guarantee the fulfillment of the stopping criterion in Step
4). In addition, it is observed that in each iteration, we only
need to solve the linear programming in Step 2) as well as the
dual function in Step 3). Combining this with the number of
iterations needed in practice, the computation complexity of
the proposed algorithm hence is not NP-hard.
Remark 1: It is noted that the generalized programming is
done offline and only need to be implemented once for use,
due to the assumption that only statistical knowledge of the
channel gains is available at the transmitter. In addition, in
Step 3) of the generalized programming in each iteration, the
optimal power allocation parameter of each layer is updated
by solving (29), where the dual variable ?
(i)
k employed in
(29) is updated in Step 2) of the same iteration. By repeating
such a procedure till the stopping criterion is satisfied, it is
expected that the optimal solution to the dual problem Popt-D
is obtained. During transmission, the transmitter and the relay
will therefore transmit symbols with the obtained optimal ratio
of power allocated to each layer.
Remark 2: It is also worthy to note that, for a message of L
layers, the active relay might spend more time in decoding and
encoding by employing SIC compared with that for a single
layer message. However, as all such operations can be done
with the advanced hardware nowadays, the incurred delay is
negligible and hence is not taken into account in this work.
V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
Case studies are conducted to examine the proposed EED
model and the formulated optimization problems. We consider
a square topology with the side length denoted by d, with the
source node located at the origin point (0,0) and the relay node
located at the center point (d/2,d/2), if not otherwise noted.
All destination nodes are assumed to be placed uniformly in
this square area. Moreover, we label the point (d/2,d/2) as the
reference location point where its average receiver-side SNR
from the source is referred to as the reference receiver-side
SNR in our study, i.e., the normalized average receiver-side
power for an arbitrary link i? j in our study is Pih?ij/h?sr =
Pih?ij(
d?
2
)? where Pi is the transmit power at node i and ?
is the pathloss exponent. In addition, we assume ? = 2 for
the Nakagami-? channel. Here we consider two performance
metrics in the numerical part in terms of the weighted averaged
7
EED. One is with cn = 1/N , i.e., the minimization of the
averaged EED of all users, and is denoted by P1 for reference.
The other takes the fairness issue into account, i.e., we cares
for the user with the worst EED by setting its weight parameter
to be unity and all others to be zero, and is denoted by P2 for
reference.
Further, for fair comparison, in this section, six schemes are
evaluated, including (1) the proposed relay aided JSCC scheme
with three resolution levels, (2) the direct JSCC multicast
scheme with three resolution levels, (3) relay aided JSCC
scheme with two resolution levels, (4) direct JSCC multicast
scheme with two resolution levels, (5) the mono modulation
scheme (single resolution) with relay, and (6) the mono modu-
lation scheme without relay. In addition, 64-QAM, QPSK/16-
QAM and BPSK/BPSK/16-QAM are considered for mono
system, two-level system and three-level system, respectively.
It is noted that all these schemes transmit the same number of
bits per source symbol for fair comparison.
In Figs. 4-5, the minimized average EED of all users, and
the minimized EED of the worst user of all schemes are
evaluated, respectively. It is observed that the three-level relay
aided JSCC system outperforms all the other schemes in terms
of all metrics. In the low SNR regime, it is observed that
the three-level relay aided JSCC system greatly reduces EED
than by the mono relay aided system as well as the two-layer
relay aided system. For instance, with normalized receiver-
side SNR ?15dB, in the three-level relay aided JSCC system,
the averaged EED and the worst EED are less than 0.3, as
the BPSK encoded base layer data can be possibly decoded
successfully in the extremely low SNR regime. In the mono
case, on the other hand, it is almost impossible to decode a
64-QAM constellation and its EEDs of both metrics approach
unity. Even for the two-level system, the EEDs of both metrics
are higher than 0.5, as the probability of successfully decoding
a QPSK symbol is small. It is also observed that the gaps
between different curves gradually shrink with the increased
SNR, as the probability of successfully decoding the associated
modulated symbols increases. Interestingly with normalized
SNR 15dB, the performance of the two-level system is only
slightly worse than that of the three-level system, as the
probability of successfully decoding a QPSK symbol is rel-
atively high. In other words, the base layer of the two-level
system and the first two lower layers of the three-level system
are both decodable with a high probability, and hence the
performances of both systems are comparable. Meanwhile, it
is not surprisingly to observe that the mono system performs
close to the layered JSCC system with the SNR of 25dB, i.e.,
in the high-SNR regime, for both EED metrics.
In Fig. 6, the optimized three-level relay aided JSCC system
achieves the best performance in both of the scenarios com-
pared with all the other cases. Table II shows the optimized
power allocation vectors for the proposed relay aided three-
level JSCC system. It is observed that, with extremely low
SNR (?15dB), almost all power is assigned to the base layer.
With the increasing SNR, more power assignment can be
moved to higher layers to enable high-quality reconstruction.
On the other hand, it is also observed that the optimized power
allocation vectors for the averaged EED metric and the worst

VI. CONCLUSIONS
The paper studied a relay-aided joint source-channel coding
(JSCC) multicast network containing a source, a decode-and-
forward (DF) relay, and multiple receivers. A novel EED
model for a general L-layer scalably coded source over
fading channels was provided, which was further taken as the
performance metric for the formulated optimization problems
to determine a few key parameters such as resource allocation
of different resolution layers at the source and relay. A
novel programming algorithm was developed to obtain a good
sub-optimal solution with guaranteed convergence. The case
study results showed that the proposed relay aided multi-
resolution design yields merits in suppressed EED against its
counterparts in all the considered scenarios. In particular, we
found that with more resolutions the EED performance could
be considerably improved due to finer granularity of quality
provisioning in presence of a large number of receivers with
multi-user channel diversity.

APPENDIX A
DERIVATION OF ERROR PROBABILITY OF HIERARCHICAL
CONSTELLATIONS
Here we derive the symbol error probability of each layer
of the two-layer QPSK/QPSK as an example. It is noted that
other hierarchical modulation cases can be similarly derived,
and hence here we only focus on the two-layer QPSK/QPSK
superimposed case as shown in Fig. 3 for brevity. We shall
firstly derive the symbol error rate of the base layer and then
decode the enhancement layer after applying SIC for the base
layer. Assuming that E is the average transmit energy for
each hierarchical modulated symbol1, we have E1 = ?E
assigned to the base layer symbol and E2 = (1??)E assigned
to the enhancement layer symbol. In addition, let h be the
instantaneous channel gain. Hence, the received symbol energy
1Note that for the average symbol energy of each hierarchical constellation,
we have E = P/fsym where P is the transmit power and fsym is the symbol
rate of the hierarchical constellation.

for the base layer and the enhancement layer are hE1 and hE2
respectively.
The coordinates of each superimposed symbol can be
split into the abscissa and ordinate components, which are
independently distorted by AWGN with its two-sided power
spectral density N0/2. The coordinates of the 16 points in
the constellation diagram, (xi, x

variables with the following means and variances:

A. Symbol Error Rate of Base Layer
For the base layer of the two-layer QPSK/QPSK, the
decision boundaries are the vertical axis for the abscissa
region as well as the horizontal axis for the ordinate region.
It is noted that, due to symmetry, only symbols in the first
quadrant, namely, s1 ? s4, are considered. For the abscissa
region, the conditional base layer error probabilities given each
transmitted SPC symbol can be determined and categorized
into two cases as follows,
p

if q = 2, 4.

Similarly for the ordinate region, the conditional base layer
error probabilities given each transmitted SPC symbol are
derived as follows,
p

if q = 3, 4.
(35)
Provided the assumption that each point is equally likely
transmitted, the base layer error probability of the 2-layer
QPSK/QPSK given the instantaneous channel gain can then
be given by,
p(1) =
1

q=1
(

. (36)
It is noted that the average error probability of the base layer
can be obtained by averaging over the channel gain distribution
and the details are omitted due to its simplicity.
B. Symbol Error Rate of Enhancement Layer
Note that to successfully decode the enhancement layer, the
receivers need successfully decode the base layer and apply
SIC for the base layer before decoding the enhancement layer.
For clarity, let B and E denote the events where the base and
enhancement layers of one SPC symbol are correctly detected,
respectively. Applying the definition of conditional probability,
the SER of the enhancement layer (L = 2) is expressed using
the intersection probability of events B and E as follows:
p(2) = 1? P (B ? E) = 1? P (B)P (E|B)
= 1?
(
1? p(1)
)(
1? p
(2)
cond
)
(37)
where p(1) is the SER of the base layer and p
(2)
cond
is the
conditional SER of the enhancement layer provided correct
reception of the base layer. Noting that SIC is applied for the
base layer, the received QPSK symbol of the enhancement
layer only has an average energy of hE2 remaining, its
conditional SER hence is given by the standard symbol error
equation for a QPSK demodulator as follows,
p
(2)
cond
= 2Q
[
?
hE2
N0
]
?Q
[
?

]2
. (38)
Incorporating (36) and (38) into (37), the SER of the enhance-
ment layer given the instantaneous channel gain can hence be
obtained. It is also noted that the average error probability of
the enhancement layer can be obtained by averaging over the
channel gain distribution and the details are omitted due to its
simplicity.
In addition, it is worth noting that, similar derivations of
SER can be applied to other hierarchical constellation cases
and are omitted here for brevity.
APPENDIX B
DETAILED SER ANALYSIS OF JSCC
Here we present the error probability derivation, with the
assumption that the power allocated to each layer is specified
and the channel realizations are known. Conditional on the
assumption that the lower l ? 1 layers have been decoded
correctly, the associated conditional symbol error rate (SER)
for the lth layer information over link i-j can be computed
and is denoted by p
(l)
ij,cond (i = s, r and j = r, d1, . . . , dN ).
2
Taking into account the dependence of decoding of each layer
symbols, the probability of the event that the lower l?1 layer
symbols are decoded successfully while the decoder fails in
decoding the lth layer symbol, is hence given by

where 1?p
(k)
ij,cond is the successful decoding probability of the
kth layer symbol conditional on the successful decoding of the
lower k ? 1 layer symbols. In addition, it is readily observed
that, when the decoder fails in decoding the kth (k < l) layer
symbol, the higher layer symbols (including the lth layer) are
naturally lost. Taking into account all these scenarios, the exact

two-layer QPSK/QPSK in Fig. 3 is derived in Appendix A. The derivations
for other superimposed SPC symbol cases are however omitted for brevity.

where the first term denotes the event that the lower l?1 layers
are successfully decoded while only the lth layer is lost in SIC
decoding, and each element of the second term in summation
denotes the event that the lower pth (p < l) layer symbol is
lost in SIC decoding hence the higher lth layer is naturally
lost. Specifically, we have

denoting the probability that only up to layer l ? 1 over link

Since each destination node receives JSCC symbols via both
the direct and relay links which are decoded separately, the
E2E SER of up to layer l at the end of the second slot at
dn, given the realized link gains, denoted by p
(l)
err,dn
, is hence
given in 3.
By averaging over the distribution of all the associated
channel power gains, the expected E2E SER of up to layer

link i? j.
APPENDIX C
EED OF L-RESOLUTION SCALABLE SOURCE
Here the EED of an L-resolution scalable source over a
memoryless broadcast channel with a finite size of codebook
for each layer is derived. As shown in Fig. 2, z denotes a
M -dimensional real-valued vector source over the Euclidean
space ? with its pdf f(z). The associated variance per
dimension is hence determined by
?
?
||z||2f(z)dz/M . Note
that here z is transmitted as an L-resolution scalably encoded
source over a discrete memoryless broadcast channel and char-
acterized by a transition matrix with its transitional probability
Pr{r?|r}, where r? is the channel output and r is the channel
input.
Due to its scalably encoding nature, the Euclidean space ?
is first partitioned into N1 disjoint regions for the base layer,
denoted by Ak (k = 1, . . . , N1) where N1 is the number
of codeword vectors for the base layer, i.e., the size of the
codebook for the base layer. For the first enhancement layer,
each of the N1 disjoint regions is partitioned into N2 disjoint
regions, denoted by Aik (i = 1, . . . , N1 and k = 1, . . . , N2)
where N2 is the number of codeword vectors for the first
enhancement layer. Similarly, the Euclidean space can be
repeatedly partitioned into more disjoint regions for the higher
enhancement layers. For the (L ? 1)th enhancement layer,
each of the
?L?1
i=1 Ni regions is partitioned into NL disjoint
regions, denoted by Ai1···iL (il = 1, . . . , Nl and l = 1, . . . , L)
where Nl is the number of codeword vectors for the l ? 1th
enhancement layer, i.e., the size of the codebook for the
l ? 1th enhancement layer. The vector associated with the
region Ai1···iL is denoted by zi1···iL . The original source is
therefore represented by the index vector (i1, . . . , iL) where
ik represents the kth layer, i.e., the (k ? 1)th enhancement
layer if k > 1 and the base layer if k = 0.
Let ?t(i1, . . . , iL) = (r1, . . . , rL) be a one-to-one mapping
from the index vector to the channel input vector. Let the
output vector be (r?1, . . . , r?L) where r?k ? {rk, e} and e denotes
detection error. As defined in Sec III-C, p?err,Lj is the detection
error probability of up to layer j, hence is given by
p?err,Lj =
j?1
?
k=1
p?err,Lk + Pr{r?1 = r1, . . . , r?j?1 = rj?1, rj = e},
j = 1, . . . , L. (41)
Note that each channel input vector (r1, . . . , rL) is uniformly
distributed over me =
?L
i=1 Ni, we have
p?err,L1 =

Given the L-layer output r?, there are L+ 1 possible outputs:
1)E[z] if r?1 = e;
l)z1?l?1 if r?1 6= e, . . . , r?l?1 6= e, r?l = e; l = 2, . . . , L
L+ 1)z1?L if r? 6= e.
The associated crossover error probabilities are hence given
by,
p?te (E[z]|z) = Pr{r1 = e|r}, (44)
p?te (z1?l?1|z) = Pr{r1, . . . , rl?1, rl = e|r},
l = 2, . . . , L, (45)
p?te (z1?L|z) = Pr{r? 6= e|r}. (46)
where E[z] is proved to be optimal when error is found at the
base layer in [10]. Note also that EED is the mean squared
error distortion between the original source z and the output
z? ? {E[z], z1?l} (l = 1, . . . , L). Therefore, with the error

probability derived above, it is given as follows,
