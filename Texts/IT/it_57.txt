Abstract—In this paper, we consider a device-to-device com-
munication network in which K transmitter-receiver pairs are
sharing spectrum with each other. We propose a novel but
simple binary scheduling scheme for this network to maximize
the average sum rate of the pairs. According to the scheme,
each receiver predicts its Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio
(SINR), assuming all other user pairs are active, and compares
it to a preassigned threshold to decide whether its corresponding
transmitter to be activated or not. For our proposed scheme,
the optimal threshold that maximizes the expected sum rate is
obtained analytically for the two user-pair case and empirically
in the general K user-pair case. Simulation results reveal that
our proposed SINR-threshold scheduling scheme outperforms
ITLinQ [1], FlashLinQ [2] and the method presented in [3]
in terms of the expected sum rate (network throughput). In
addition, the computational complexity of the proposed scheme
is O(K), outperforming both ITLinQ and FlashLinQ that have
O(K2) complexity requirements. Moreover, we also discuss the
application of our proposed new scheme into an operator-assisted
cellular D2D heterogeneous network.
I. INTRODUCTION
Device-to-Device (D2D) refers to a wireless communica-
tion technology that enables direct communication between
nearby devices. Establishing D2D communication links offers
a means for offloading traffic over a cellular network. Once
D2D communication links are connected and established, it is
unnecessary to use the base station (BS) or other intermediate
devices for data transmission. Driven by the prevalence of
smart devices, the rapid growth of data load and internet of
things, the forthcoming 5G aims at achieving significantly
higher rates per unit area and significantly lower latency than
the current LTE systems. Thus, the D2D technology is widely
recognized, e.g., by 3GPP, as one of the key technologies for
5G. To achieve the promised D2D benefits in 5G, several chal-
lenges need to be addressed, such as D2D user detection and
identification [4], D2D synchronization [5], wireless resource
management [6], power control and interference management
[7], and efficient handovers between cellular access and D2D
[8]. In this paper, we focus on sharing the D2D channel among
multiple user pairs and develop simple methods for power
control and interference management.
A. The Problem
A D2D wireless network consisting of K transmitter-
receiver pairs is traditionally abstracted as a K-user interfer-
ence channel. Although the capacity characterization of the
K-user interference channel is still one of the most funda-
mental open problems in information theory, several recent
discoveries have significantly advanced our understanding of
the capacity limits, such as linear deterministic models [9]
and interference alignment [10], almost all requiring global
channel state information (CSI) be available at each user node.
As far as practical system designs are concerned, it is
imperative to keep the encoding and decoding schemes as
simple as possible. One such simple scheme in multiuser in-
terference management is treating interference as noise (TIN)
at the receiver. Recently, Geng et al. in [11] identified a TIN-
optimality condition under which TIN is generalized degrees-
of-freedom (GDoF) optimal and achieves the capacity region
within a constant gap. However, the gap in the finite SNR
regime could be large, particularly if the size of the network
scales up. In addition, scheduling a small subset of users
satisfying the TIN-optimality condition may not be necessarily
the right metric for maximizing the expected sum rate in the
network. Thus, the sum rate characterization of the K-user
interference channel remains open. In particular, selecting a
subset of user pairs which results in the highest sum rate has
not been fully solved yet. On this avenue, the problem we
investigate in this work can be concisely expressed as follows:
How to design a simple scheduling scheme with binary power
control based on local (not global) CSI to achieve a higher
sum rate than the state-of-the-art scheduling schemes?
B. The Prior Works
On multiuser scheduling, there are a few recent works
considering SINR-based methods, such as [12] where a greedy
algorithm was developed to improve the packet reception rate,
but only an approximation of the optimal scheduling scheme
is obtained in, e.g., [12]–[14]. Moreover, only a bound on
SINR is derived and the ergodic sum rate is not characterized
in [12]. Besides SINR-based methods, a SNR-based scheme
was introduced in [7] and [3] where whether to activate a
link or not depends on the direct link information only. Since
the interference links are not taken into account, activating a
user-pair which causes strong interference to the others would
reduce the sum rate of the network.
Of the vast amount of literature on the sum rate character-
ization of a D2D network, the most closely related to this
work are references [1]–[3]. Recently, Wu et al. proposed
a scheme referred to as FlashLinQ in [2]. It is a multiuser

scheduling scheme where a user pair is scheduled if that user
pair meets the FlashLinQ condition. The key of FlashLinQ is
to activate a user-pair if the received SINR is strong enough
and deactivate them if the transmitter generates too much
interference. Instead of testing the SINRs, Naderializadeh and
Avestimehr proposed another scheme referred to as ITLinQ
in [1]. Inspired by the TIN-optimality condition [11], they
defined a new concept of information-theoretic independent
sets (ITISs), which indicates the sets of links for which si-
multaneous communication and treating the interference from
each other as noise is information-theoretically optimal (to
within a constant gap). Based on this concept, they developed a
new spectrum sharing mechanism, called information-theoretic
link scheduling (ITLinQ), which at each time schedules those
links that form an ITIS. It was demonstrated in [1] that
ITLinQ can substantially improve over FlashLinQ. One great
attribute of FlashLinQ and ITLinQ is that each user-pair is
able to make the scheduling decision based on their local CSI.
However, both schemes generate the active set incrementally,
by checking the TIN type-optimality condition one user-pair at
a time. Also, they require the presence of a central controller,
which establishes a user-pair ordering that is to be used to
generate the active user-pair set. As we elaborate in Section
III, they both have computational complexity O(K2) and
substantial overheads, rendering them inefficient at this stage
for practical D2D implementation. Built upon ITLinQ, Yi et
al. proposed the ITLinQ+ scheme in [15] to achieve higher
spectral efficiency via sophisticated non-binary power control.
To address the O(K2) computational complexity burden,
Kerret et al. developed a binary power control scheme for the
K = 2 interference channel in the framework of game theory.
Specifically, each user-pair is selfishly turned on if the desired
signal power is above a predetermined threshold. While the
computational complexity of the method in [3], referred to
as the SNR-based scheme, is reduced to O(K), the sum rate
performance is also worse than FlashLinQ and ITLinQ, due
to the fact that the interference is not taken into account.
C. Contributions
In this paper, we propose a novel and quite simple SINR-
threshold scheduling scheme with one-bit feedback and bi-
nary power control. Specifically, in a D2D network with K
transmitter-receiver pairs, the central controller of the network,
e.g., a macro BS, broadcasts an optimal threshold to each
receiver. Each receiver tests if its SINR, assuming all links
are active, is above the given threshold based on its local
CSI at the receiver (CSIR), different from the requirements
of CSI at both the transmitter and the receiver for ITLinQ
and FlashLinQ. Then each receiver feeds back this binary
decision to its corresponding transmitter, so that the transmitter
is either active in full power transmission or inactive. The
predetermined threshold is a function of K and it is broadcast
to the users. In this work we derive the optimal threshold value
(in terms of maximizing the expected sum rate) in closed form
for K = 2 user-pair case, assuming all channels are i.i.d.
and Rayleigh distributed. We also empirically optimize the
threshold for general K-user case, involving more realistic
wireless channel models, including pathloss and shadowing,
etc. As our simulation-based sum rate analysis reveals, the
proposed scheme outperforms the ones in [1]–[3]. For exam-
ple, given the network with the parameters defined in [1] and
K = 800, the simulation reveals that our scheme gains roughly
13%, 75% and 128% sum rate increases compared to ITlinQ,
FlashLinQ and the SNR-based scheme, respectively.
D. Significance
We next make a few important observations regarding the
significance of this work. First, as mentioned earlier in this
section, the sum rate characterization of D2D interference
networks has attracted a lot of attention both in theory aiming
at understanding the fundamental capacity limit via developing
many ingenious ideas, and in practice with the goal of develop-
ing schemes as simple as possible to achieve the performance
as higher as possible. Our work falls into the later category.
Second, our scheme outperforms in delivered sum rate of
ITLinQ, FlashLinQ and the SNR-based scheme introduced in
[1]–[3]. We also set forth two different scheduling approaches
for improving user fairness at the cost of sum rate perfor-
mance. At the same time, fairness should be considered under
the umbrella of cellular, as the availability of cellular access
provides an alternative to D2D for serving certain user pairs.
In light of this observation, the sum rate appears to be a
reasonable optimization metric for D2D networks.
Third, compared to FlashLinQ and ITLinQ, the computa-
tional complexity of our scheme is also significantly reduced
from O(K2) to O(K). And last but not least, from the
network-wide operational perspective, our scheme only needs
the central controller to broadcast a SINR threshold to all the
users in the network according to the network size, which is
much simpler than FlashLinQ and ITLinQ.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider a wireless D2D network where there are K
transmitter-receiver pairs (Txi,Rxi) for i = 1, 2, · · · ,K, each
node equipped with one antenna only, and each Txi aims to
send one independent message to its intended Rxi. Formulated
as a K-user interference channel, the system input-output
relationship can be characterized by the following equation:
yi(t) =
K?
j=1
hijxj(t) + zi(t), i ? K , {1, 2, · · · ,K}, (1)
where yi(t) represents the received signal at Rxi at time
t; xj(t) represents the transmitted signal from Txj at time
t satisfying the power constraint E[ 1T
?T
t=1 |xj(t)|2] ? P ;
zi(t) ? CN (0, No) denotes the i.i.d. additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN); hji represents the complex channel coefficient
from Txi to Rxj . We assume that the channel coefficients
hij’s are drawn from a continuous distribution, which will be
specified in detail in Section IV and Section V, and they stay
constant during the entire transmission once they are drawn.
We also assume that all the transmitter-receiver pairs share
a common wireless medium, i.e., given the same chunk of
frequency-time resources, we need to deal with considerable
multiuser interference. In this work, we assume that local CSI
is available at each receiver, i.e., {hij}Kj=1 is known to Rxi. In
practice, this can be accomplished by training the channels via
sending a pilot symbol from each transmitter to all receivers
at a time and allowing each receiver for channel estimation.
Next, we introduce the formal definition of binary power
control aiming at maximizing the expected sum rate based on
the local CSI at each receiver.
A. Binary Power Control
Consider the Best Response (BR) approach introduced in
[3], and define the binary power control function at Txi as:
pi(fi) : fi ?? {0, P}, i ? K, (2)
where fi ? R+ represents the feedback function from Rxi to
Txi, and the optimal power control scheme can be written as
(p?1, · · · , p?K) = arg max
(p1,··· ,pK)?P
E[R?(p1(f1), · · · , pK(fK))] (3)
where P indicates the set corresponding to all possible power
control functions (p1, · · · , pK).
This optimization problem is a typical Team Decision
problem [16] due to the fact that each transmitter aims to
maximize the ergodic sum rate based on their individual
channel information. To simplify this optimization problem,
a modified version of BR for the K = 2 case was defined in
[3] and is rewritten as follows:
Definition 1 [3]: (pBR1 , p
BR
2 ) are the best response power
control functions if they satisfy
pBR1 ? arg max
(p1,pBR2 )?P
E[R?(p1(f1), pBR2 (f2))],
pBR2 ? arg max
(pBR1 ,p2)?P
E[R?(pBR1 (f1), p2(f2))].
(4)
It should be noted that the best response defined in [3] is
only based on the CSI of the direct link, i.e., without con-
sidering interference, and the optimal power control functions
(p1, p2) are also the best response power control functions [3].
III. THE PROPOSED SINR-THRESHOLD SCHEDULING
SCHEME
Since resolving the optimization problem (3) is complicated,
we focus on a smaller functional space called a threshold
function. In addition, to reduce the feedback cost, we impose
the constraint that each feedback function fi has up to one
bit only, i.e., its entropy is upper bounded by one. In this
section, we propose a novel and very simple SINR-threshold
scheduling scheme based on local CSIR for the binary power
control problem. The scheme consists of the learning phase,
the scheduling phase and the communication phase.
A. The Learning Phase
In this phase, each Rxi acquires its local CSI of {hij}Kj=1,
by reading the pilot symbol sent by one transmitter every time.
Then, all users predict their SINRs by assuming all links to
be active. The predicted SINR at Rxi is calculated as follows:
SINRi ,
|hii|2?
j 6=i |hij |2 +No/P
, i ? K. (5)
B. The Scheduling Phase
After completing the learning phase, each Rxi compares
its SINR with the threshold ? which is prior assigned by,
e.g., the macro-cell BS to each receiver. Then each receiver
distributively determines whether to activate its corresponding
transmitter or not according to the following definition.
Definition 2 (The SINR-Threshold Scheduling with Binary
Power Control): We choose the feedback function as an
indicator function fi , 1(SINRi??), and a functional subset
G ? P is defined as:
G,{(p1,· · ·, pK)|(p1,· · ·, pK) ? P, pi(fi) = P1(fi), i ? K} (6)
where 1(x) is the indicator function with 1(x) = 1 if x ? 0
and 1(x) = 0 if x < 0.
After the value of fi is fed from Rxi back to Txi1, the
transmitter Txi determines its status in the next phase of data
transmission via the mapping function pi(fi). Specifically, Txi
will be activated with full power if the received SINR at
its corresponding receiver is above its preassigned threshold;
Otherwise Txi will keep silent. Thus, only the user pairs in the
subset S , {i|fi = 1} are scheduled for transmission given
the channel realizations H , {hij |i, j ? K}.
Remark 1: Since the feedback fi is an indicator function,
it contains up to one bit only. Also, the SINR threshold ?
depends on both the desired signal power and interference
strength. In contrast, the threshold in [3] depends on the CSI
of the desired link only (i.e., the SNR). Thus, one can expect
that the sum rate of our scheme outperforms that in [3].
C. The Communication Phase
After determining the subset S of user pairs for scheduling,
the scheduled user-pair i can achieve the following rate2 by
using TIN as the decoding scheme:
Ri(H, ?) = log
(
1 +
|hii|2?
j?S,j 6=i |hij |2 +No/P
)
, ?i ? S. (7)
Thus, the following sum rate R?(H, ?) and the ergodic sum
rate R??(?) are achievable:
R?(H, ?) =
?
i?S
Ri(H, ?), (8)
R??(?) = EH [R?(H, ?)]. (9)
Finally, the optimal sum rate of the network offered by our
scheme is characterized by the optimization problem:
max R??(?) s.t. ? ? [0,+?). (10)
Remark 2: Consider the computational complexity of our
scheme, ITLinQ and FlashLinQ. Since they all require local
CSIR which can be obtained with the linear complexity, we do
not consider the cost of acquiring CSI and the corresponding
SINR values, but consider the scheduling decision making
only. In our scheme, each receiver only needs to compare
1The availability of feedback can be accomplished via either the feedback
channel from the receiver to its transmitter or the help of the macro-cell BS
through uplink and then downlink cellular transmission.
2Even without CSIT, the rate in (7) can be achieved arbitrarily closely with
HARQ at the cost of decoding delay, if the traffic is not delay sensitive.
its SINR to the given threshold for once, so that the total
computational complexity of K user-pairs is given by O(K).
In contrast, in both ITLinQ and FlashLinQ, when we check
whether or not to add a new user-pair into the subset including
user pairs chosen for scheduling, we have to check their
corresponding conditions at each transmitter and each receiver
in that subset, and schedule the new transmitter-receiver pair
if they both satisfy the condition. This results in the total
complexity up to 6 + 9 + · · ·+ 3K = 1.5(K+ 2)(K?1), i.e.,
O(K2). Thus, the computational complexity of our proposed
scheme outperforms both ITLinQ and FlashLinQ.
Based on the proposed scheme, it can be seen that to achieve
the maximum sum rate in (10), we need to find out the value
of the corresponding optimal threshold ?. To do this, we will
begin with deriving the closed form expression of the expected
sum rate for the K = 2 case in Section IV, and then proceed to
evaluating the expected sum rate for the general K-user case
via simulation in Section V, followed by a few discussions.
IV. OPTIMAL THRESHOLD SELECTION
In this section, we first analytically derive the optimal
threshold for K = 2. For the general K-user case, due to the
difficulty of expressing the closed form ergodic rate in terms
of the threshold, the optimal threshold can be numerically
obtained based on search over the effective SINR regime.
For K = 2, to simplify the problem (10) as much as
possible, we assume the channel coefficients hji’s are i.i.d. and
follow the Rayleigh distribution hji ? CN (0, 1), and the noise
is normalized to unit power No = 1, the same assumption as
in [3]. Under this setting, we have the following lemma:
Lemma 1: Suppose p?ii , i = 1, 2 are power control functions,
then there exists a pair (??1 , ?
?
2 ) so that (p
?
1, p
?
2) = (p
?1
?
1 , p
?2
?
2 ).
Proof. The proof follows directly from [3] where we replace
the SNR threshold with the SINR threshold in this paper.
To maximize the ergodic sum rate in (10), we will develop
the analytical expression of the sum rate R?? in (10) for K = 2,
and then find out the optimal threshold. For brevity, we rewrite
the mapping function pi = Xi as follows:
Xi ,
{
1 if gii ? ?(gi?i + 1P )
0 if else i = 1, 2 and i? , 3? i
(11)
where gij , |hij |2 for ?i, j follow the exponential distribution
with mean one. Hence, the ergodic sum rate is given by:
R??(?) = E[R1 +R2] = 2E[R1] (12)

(14)
where the first equal sign in (13) is due to the fact that the

By substituting EX2 [X2] = Prob(X2 = 1) = e

Note that given the power P , R??(?) depends on the threshold
? only. To find the optimal threshold ??, we take the first
derivative of R??(?) w.r.t. ? and solve dR??(?)/d?|?=?? = 0.
While the closed form expression of ?? is difficult to derive,
it can be solved by applying many numerical algorithms such
as the Newton method and the gradient descending algorithm,
and the result can be easily verified via simulation.
For the general K-user case, we resort to simulations. In
particular, we use 1Ts
?Ts
t=1 R??(Ht, ?) to approximate R??(?)
by letting Ts be large enough where Ts is the total number
of randomly drawn channel realization sets and Ht represents
the tth set for t = 1, 2, · · · , Ts. In addition, when the user
distance, channel fading and shadowing are taken into account,
the objective function R??(?) is not convex and even not
continuous w.r.t. ? due to use of the indicator function. Thus,
we need to develop a new method to find the global optimal
?? in Problem (10). We state our result as follows.
Lemma 2: There exists an optimal ?? so that R??(?) ?
R??(?
?), and ?? can be obtained in O(KTs).
Proof. We show first the converse and then the achievability.
(Converse) Recall the scheduling policy in Definition 2
where user-pairs are scheduled only if their SINRs are no
less than ?. That is, once a realization set H is given, the
predicted SINR at each receiver is determined. Let us sort
the SINRs as SINR?(1) < SINR?(2) < · · · < SINR?(K)
where ?(k) maps to the index of the user pair which has
the kth smallest value of SINR. It can be easily seen that
for ? ? [SINR?(k?1),SINR?(k)), R?(H, ?) is a continuous
function of ?. Thus, given Ts channel realization sets {Ht}Tst=1,
R??(?) is still piecewise continuous of ?. Also, note that the
effective SINR regime to choose ? from is bounded by the
smallest and the largest values of SINRs obtained from K
receivers over Ts times. For a piecewise continuous function
on a bounded regime, R??(?) is also upper bounded.
(Achievability) For ? ? [SINR?(k?1),SINR?(k)), R?(H, ?)
is not only continuous but also piecewise constant valued w.r.t.
?. Hence, when ? increases, R?(H, ?) can achieve a new
value only when ? hits an SINRi value for i ? K. Thus, given
Ts channel realization sets {Ht}Tst=1, we only need to calculate
R??(?) when ? = SINRHt?(k), i.e., the SINRs when Ht is given.
Since there are K users and Ts channel realization sets for
simulation, the optimal threshold ?? can be found out from
the corresponding largest R??(SINRHt?(k)) in O(KTs).
V. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
In this section, we will numerically compare the perfor-
mance of the SINR-threshold scheduling scheme proposed in
this paper with ITLinQ, Fair ITLinQ, FlashLinQ and the SNR-
based scheduling scheme studied in [1]–[3] in terms of the sum
ergodic rate and the CDFs of the user rates for the general K-
user D2D network depicted in Fig. 1. Note that choosing these
two metrics is consistent with [1]- [2] for a fair comparison.
As far as the parameter setting is concerned, we consider
the size of the area is given by 1000m×1000m, and there
are K transmitter-receiver pairs randomly dropped. For fair
performance comparison, the same as in [1], we consider the
distance between each transmitter and its receiver is drawn
from the uniform distribution U [2m, 65m]. Furthermore, we
assume that the maximum transmit power for each user is
given by P = 20 dBm, and the noise power spectral density
is No = ?184 dBm/Hz respectively. The noise figure is set
to 7 dB, and the antenna gain per device is assumed to be
?2.5 dB. Moreover, we assume that the carrier frequency is
2.4 GHz and the bandwidth is 5 MHz. In addition, we assume
that all antennas heights are set to be 1.5m. As far as path
loss is concerned, the transmission power loss in dB value at
distance d can be modeled the same as [1] as follows

A. The Expected Sum Rate Comparison
Fig. 2 demonstrates the average sum rate of our proposed
scheme, ITLinQ [1], FairITLinQ [1], FlashLinQ [2] and the
SNR-based scheduling scheme [3]. Regarding the ITLinQ
scheme, to have a fair comparison, we consider the optimal
value for parameter ? of ITLinQ (which captures the interplay
between the desired signal power and strongest interference
power, see [1]). For FairITLinQ, we consider following setting
of parameters: SNRth = 110 dB, M = 25 dB, M? = 20 dB
and ?? = 0.6 (see [1]). As far as FlashLinQ is concerned,
we follow similar implementation considered in [2] with
?TX = ?RX = 9 dB. As Fig. 2 shows, the sum rate of our
proposed scheme always outperforms all the other schemes.
In particular, our scheme can gain roughly 13%, 22%, 75%
and 128% rate increases compared to ITlinQ [1], FairITLinQ
[1], FlashLinQ [2] and SNR-based scheme [3], respectively,
in the setting with K = 800.
Fig. 3 provides the corresponding CDF curves of all the
schemes shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen the sum rate gain
of our scheme is at the cost of user fairness. For example,
the proposed scheme deactivates roughly 81% of user pairs,
significantly higher than 50% of ITLinQ and 40% of Flash-
LinQ. However, as mentioned earlier in this paper, fairness
in a D2D network only should not be a fatal issue, because
fairness should be considered under the umbrella of cellular
heterogeneous networks.
B. Discussion: Trade Sum Rates for the User Fairness
Although the fairness is not our focus in this work, we still
provide two potential promising approaches which are able to
improve the user fairness at the cost of, unsurprisingly, the
sum rates. We present the two approaches as follows.

Fig. 3. The CDF of user rates in the proposed scheme compared to ITLinQ,
Fair ITLinQ, FlashLinQ, and the SNR-based scheme for K = 800 users.
1) Modified Proposed Scheme 1 (Enforcing A Portion of
Links to be Activated): The idea is to enforce partial user
links to be activated, no matter if their received SINRs are
strong enough or not. For the remaining user pairs, we directly
apply our scheme considering the interference generated by the
enforced user pairs simultaneously.
Consider an example where 10% of user links are enforced
to be activated in a Round Robin manner. The average sum rate
and the user rate CDF curves for K = 800 are shown in Fig.
4 and Fig. 5, compared to our originally proposed scheme and
ITLinQ. It can be easily seen that the number of inactive user
links reduces from 81% to 0 because each user has a chance to
talk due to Round Robin scheduling. Also, although we lose
a certain sum rate compared to our proposed original scheme,
we can still achieve higher sum rate than other schemes in
[1]–[3] while keeping the computational complexity benefit.
2) Modified Proposed Scheme 2 (Reducing Threshold to
Activate More Links): The idea is to reduce the threshold from
the optimal value by a certain level, so that more user pairs
could be scheduled.
Consider ? = ????v as an example where ?? is the optimal
threshold according to our original scheme, ?v is a constant
to be designed, and ? is the threshold that we apply in this
modified scheme. The average sum rate and the user rates
CDF curves for K = 800 are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5
and compared to ITLinQ and FlashLinQ. Since decreasing the
threshold results in more fairness at the cost the sum rate, the
offset ?v can be tuned to gain a tradeoff between the sum
rate and the user fairness. Under our simulation setting and
consider K = 800 as an example. When we choose ?v = 0.45,
Fig. 5 reveals that the user fairness of this modified scheme
can be also improved compared to the original scheme, and we
still have the sum rate gain, roughly 4.2% more than ITlinQ
and the computational complexity benefit.
Remark 3: Observations of Fig. 5 reveal that when user
rates are very close to zero, the modified propose scheme

original proposed scheme, ITLinQ, Fair ITLinQ, FlashLinQ, and the SNR-
based scheme for K = 800 users.
1 outperforms both Fair ITLinQ and FlashLinQ in terms of
fairness. On the other hand, from the operational perspective,
all the schemes identified in Fig. 5 are not very efficient in
terms of fairness, since roughly 2/3 of the users cannot achieve
rate significantly larger than zero. One possible method is to
schedule a subset of users instead of considering all users
(corresponding activity fraction equal to one) during each slot.
C. Thresholds for Network Operation
Since the optimal threshold ?? developed from Section IV
is a function of the network size K, it can be predetermined in
the network design. Based on our approaches in Section IV,
Fig. 6 demonstrates the optimal threshold values for different
K values. When the D2D network is being operated, the macro
BS only needs to first find the threshold values according to
the network size, and then broadcast this value to all users in
the D2D network. Meanwhile, the thresholds of the modified
schemes 1 and 2 introduced above are also shown in Fig. 6.

D. Cellular-assisted D2D Network Operation
Observations of the user fairness result shown in Section
V reveal that all the schemes identified in Fig. 5 are not
efficient. However, as mentioned earlier in this paper, fairness
by itself is not a fatal issue due to the fact that fairness in D2D
networks should be considered under the umbrella of cellular
heterogeneous networks, i.e., each user-pair can be activated in
both either D2D or cellular bands. Due to the space limitation
and since the user fairness is not the focus of this work, we
will briefly discuss the cellular-assisted D2D heterogeneous
networks, and defer the detailed analysis into the future work.
We consider a simple example of a cellular-assisted D2D
heterogeneous network where in the D2D network, the rate of
user k is given by R?k(?) = EH(Rk(H, ?)). On the other hand,
in the cellular network, there are B cells, each with one BS in
the cell center, and each BS schedules Kc user at each time.
After BS-user association and load balancing, each scheduled
user is associated with one BS only. Meanwhile, we assume
that the nominal user rate provided by the cellular network is
given by Rc, implying that the ergodic user rate provided by
the cellular network is given by R?c = RcBKc/K. Suppose
the total bandwidth is W , and we orthogonally allocate the
bandwidth W to the cellular network, denoted by ?W , and
the D2D network, denoted by (1??)W . Then the rate ?R?c+
(1? ?)R?k is achievable for user k via time-sharing between
the two rates provided by cellular and D2D, respectively. By
doing so, each user can independently choose either D2D or
cellular access at each time, and most of the users whose rates
in the D2D network are very close to zero can still be served
in the cellular network, so as to alleviate the user fairness.
While the idea of time sharing is very simple and easy
to operate, the achievable rate can further be significantly
improved by jointly designing user scheduling between D2D
and cellular, in particular when we take into account the
pathloss and channel fading of the cellular transmission.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduced a novel but quite simple
binary scheduling scheme based on SINR-threshold schedul-
ing. The scheme was based on treating interference as noise
at each receiver and SINR-threshold scheduling with binary
power control. In particular, the SINR at each receiver is
predicted assuming all the other user-pairs are active. This
SINR prediction is then compared to an optimal preassigned
threshold in order to determine whether or not to activate the
individual link. Subsequently, the receiver feeds back this one-
bit decision information to its corresponding transmitter, so
that the transmitter is either activated with full power or silent
for data transmission. As we showed by both analysis and
system level evaluations, when compared to the prior schemes
such as ITLinQ [1], Fair ITLinQ [1], FlashLinQ [2] and the
SNR-based method [3], our proposed scheme outperforms
them in terms of sum rate. In addition, the computational
complexity of the proposed scheme is lower than ITLinQ and
FlashLinQ and on par with the SNR-based method.
