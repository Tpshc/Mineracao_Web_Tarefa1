Radio-Inspired NOMA Systems
Yuehua Yu, He Chen, Yonghui Li, Zhiguo Ding, and Li Zhuo
Abstract—This letter investigates a joint antenna selection (AS)
problem for a MIMO cognitive radio-inspired non-orthogonal
multiple access (CR-NOMA) network. In particular, a new
computationally efficient joint AS algorithm, namely subset-based
joint AS (SJ-AS), is proposed to maximize the signal-to-noise
ratio of the secondary user under the condition that the quality
of service (QoS) of the primary user is satisfied. The asymptotic
closed-form expression of the outage performance for SJ-AS is
derived, and the minimal outage probability achieved by SJ-AS
among all possible joint AS schemes is proved. The provided
numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed scheme.

I. INTRODUCTION
Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and cognitive
radio (CR) have emerged as efficient techniques to improve
the spectral efficiency [1], [2]. By naturally combining the
concepts of both NOMA and CR, a cognitive radio-inspired
NOMA (CR-NOMA) scheme was proposed and studied in
[3]. In CR-NOMA, the unlicensed secondary users (SU) is
opportunistically served under the condition that the quality
of service (QoS) of the licensed primary users (PU) is sat-
isfied. As a result, the transmit power allocated to the SU
is constrained by the instantaneous signal-to-interference-plus-
noise ratio (SINR) of the PU. Compared to the conventional
CR systems, higher spectral efficiency can be achieved by
CR-NOMA because both the PU and SU can be served
simultaneously using the same spectrum.
Recently, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) tech-
niques have been considered in CR-NOMA systems to exploit
the spatial degrees of freedom [4]. To avoid high hardware
costs and computational burden while preserving the diversity
and throughput benefits from MIMO, the antenna selection
(AS) problem for MIMO CR-NOMA systems has been inves-
tigated in [5], wherein the SU was assumed to be rate adaptive
and the design criterion was to maximize the SU’s rate subject
to the QoS of PU. On the other hand, the outage probability
has also been commonly used to quantify the performance
of AS for an alternative scenario, wherein users have fixed

transmission rates [6]. To the best of the authors’ knowledge,
the outage-oriented AS schemes for CR-NOMA systems have
not been studied in open literature.
Motivated by this, the design and analysis of the outage-
oriented joint AS algorithm for MIMO CR-NOMA networks
is studied in this letter, which is fundamentally different from
that for orthogonal multiple access (OMA) networks. This is
because there is severe inter-user interference in NOMA sce-
narios, wherein the signals are transmitted in an interference-
free manner in OMA scenarios. Moreover, the transmit power
allocated to the SU in CR-NOMA scenarios is constrained by
the instantaneous SINR of the PU, which is affected by the
antenna selection result. In this case, the joint antenna selection
for NOMA networks is coupled with the power allocation
design at the BS, which makes the design and analysis of the
joint AS problem for CR-NOMA networks more challenging.
In this letter, we propose a new low-complexity joint AS
scheme, namely subset-based joint AS (SJ-AS), to maximize
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the SU under the condition
that the QoS of the PU is satisfied. The asymptotic closed-form
expression of the outage performance for SJ-AS is derived,
and the minimal outage probability achieved by SJ-AS among
all possible joint AS schemes is proved. Numerical results
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROPOSED JOINT AS SCHEME
Consider a MIMO CR-NOMA downlink scenario as [4],
wherein two users including one PU and one SU are paired in
one group to perform NOMA. We consider that BS, PU and
SU are equipped with N , M and K antennas, respectively. We
assume that the channels between the BS and users undergo
spatially independent flat Rayleigh fading, then the entries
of the channel matrix, e.g., h?nm (g?nk), can be modelled
as independent and identically distributed complex Gaussian
random variables, where h?nm (g?nk) represents the channel
coefficient between the nth antenna of the BS and the mth
(kth) antenna of the PU (SU). For notation simplicity, we
define hnm = |h?nm|2 and gnk = |g?nk|2.
As in [7], we consider that the BS selects one (e.g., nth)
out of its N antennas to transmit information, while the users
select one (e.g., mth and kth) out of M and K available
antennas respectively to receive massages. In this sense, only
one RF chain is needed at each node to reduce the hardware
cost, power consumption and complexity, and only the partial
channel state information, i.e., the channel amplitudes, is
2
needed at the BS, which is assumed perfectly known at the
BS through the control signalling.
According to the principle of NOMA, the BS broadcasts the
superimposed signals
?
asp +
?
bss, where sp (ss) denotes the
signal to the PU (SU) with E[|sp|2] = E[|ss|2] = 1, and a and
b are the power allocation coefficients satisfying a + b = 1.
Then the received signals at the PU and SU are given by
yp =
?
P h?nm
(?
asp +
?
bss
)
+ np, (1)
ys =
?
P g?nk
(?
asp +
?
bss
)
+ ns, (2)
where P is the transmit power at the BS, and np (ns) is the
complex additive white Gaussian noise with variance ?2p (?
2
s).
For simplicity, we assume ?2p = ?
2
s = ?
2.
Following the principle of CR-NOMA, sp is decoded by
treating ss as noise at both users, and ss may be recovered at
the SU when sp has been successfully subtracted in the SIC
procedure. By denoting the transmit SNR as ? = P/?2, the
received SINR of decoding sp at the PU is given by
?p = ahnm/ (bhnm + 1/?) . (3)
Similarly, the received SINR to detect sp at the SU is given by
?s?p = agnk/ (bgnk + 1/?) . (4)
When sp is successfully removed, the SNR to detect ss at the
SU is given by
?s = bgnk?. (5)
Let ?thp (?
th
s ) denotes the predetermined detecting threshold
of sp (ss). As the SU is served on the condition that ?
th
p is
met, mathematically, ?p and ?s?p should satisfy the following
constraint simultaneously: min (?p, ?s?p) > ?
th
p .
A. The Formulation of Joint AS Optimization Problem
In order to maximize the received SNR of the SU, we would
like to solve the following optimization problem:
P : {b?, n?,m?, k?} = argmax
b,n?N ,m?M,k?K
?s (b, gnk) , (6a)
s.t. min (?p, ?s?p) > ?
th
p , (6b)
0 ? b < 1. (6c)
where N={1, · · · , N},M={1, · · · ,M}, and K={1, · · · ,K}, and
P is the joint optimization problem of antenna selection and
power allocation. Specifically, similar to [8], given the antenna
indexes n, m and k, the optimal power allocation strategy b
can be obtained based on Lemma 1.
Lemma 1. Given the antenna indexes n, m and k, the optimal
power allocation strategy b is given by
b = max
((
??? ?thp
)
/
((
?thp + 1
)
??
)
, 0
)
, (7)
where ? = min (hnm, gnk).
Proof. Given antenna indexes n, m and k, by substituting
(3)-(4) into (6b), the power coefficient b should satisfy the
condition: b 6
????thp
(?thp +1)??
. Meanwhile, ?s is an increasing
function of b as shown in (5). In this case, in order to maximize
?s, b should take the maximum value in its range. By noting
that 0 6 b < 1, we then can express the optimal power
allocation coefficient b as in (7). The proof is completed.
By substituting (7) into (5) and when b > 0, we have
?s (hnm, gnk) =
min (hnm, gnk) ?? ?thp
(
?thp + 1
)
min (hnm, gnk)
gnk, (8)
otherwise ?s=0. At this point, the joint optimization problem
P is simplified into the joint antenna selection problem. It
is straightforward to see that finding the optimal antenna
indexes {n?,m?, k?} may require an exhaustive search (ES)
over all possible antenna combinations with the complexity of
1O (NMK). When N , M and K become large, the computa-
tional burden of ES may become unaffordable. Motivated by
this, an computationally efficient joint AS algorithm for MIMO
CR-NOMA systems will be developed in the next subsection.
B. Proposed Subset-based Joint AS (SJ-AS) Scheme
The aim of SJ-AS algorithm is to decrease the computa-
tional complexity by greatly reducing the searching set, while
ensuring the QoS of the PU and maximizing the achievable
SNR of the SU. Specifically, SJ-AS mainly consists of the
following three stages.
• Stage 1. Build the subset S1 =
{ (
h(n), g(n)
)
, n ? N
}
to reduce the search space, where h(n) and g(n) are the
maximum-value elements in the nth row of H and G,
respectively. Mathematically, we have
h(n) = max (hn1, · · · , hnM ) , (9)
g(n) = max (gn1, · · · , gnK) . (10)
• Stage 2. Build the subset S2 by selecting the pairs from
S1, in which each pair ensures the target SINR of the PU
can be supported and sp can be subtracted successfully
at the SU. That is,
S2 =
{
min
(
?(n)p , ?
(n)
s?p
)
> ?thp , n ? S1
}
, (11)
where ?
(n)
p and ?
(n)
s?p can be obtained by substituting h(n)
and g(n) into (3) and (4), respectively. Specifically, b(n)
is given in (7) with ?(n) = min(h(n), g(n)).
• Stage 3. When |S2| > 0, select the antenna triple which
can maximize the SNR for the SU, i.e.,
{n?,m?, k?} = argmax
{
?s
(
h(n), g(n)
)
, n ? S2
}
. (12)
Let m? and k? denote the original column indexes of
h(n
?) and g(n
?), respectively. That is, the n?th antenna at
the BS, and the m?th and k?th antennas at the PU and
SU are jointly selected. In contrast, when |S2| = 0, the
system suffers from an outage.
As mentioned before, the complexity of the ES-based
scheme is as high as O (NMK). In contrast, the complex-
ity of the proposed SJ-AS scheme is upper bounded by
O (N (M +K + 2)). For the case N =M =K , we can find
that the complexity of SJ-AS is approximately O
(
N2
)
, which
is an order of magnitude lower than O
(
N3
)
of the optimal
ES-based scheme.
1O is usually used in the efficiency analysis of algorithms and q(x) =
O (p(x)) when lim

III. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we will analyse the system outage per-
formance achieved by SJ-AS. By using the assumption that
channel coefficients are Rayleigh distributed, the cumulative
density functions (CDF) and the probability density functions
(PDF) of h(n) and g(n) in S1 can be expressed as in [5],
Fh(n)(x) =
(
1? e??hx
)M
, Fg(n)(x)=

1? e??gx
)K

fg(n)(x) = ?

?k?gx, (15)
where ?h = 1/E [him], ?g = 1/E [gnk], and fh(n)(x) and
fg(n)(x) are expanded based on the binomial theorem.
Let O1 denote the event |S2| = 0, and O2 denote the event
?
(n?)
s < ?
th
s while |S2| > 0. As in [9], the overall system
outage is defined as the event that any user in the system
cannot achieve reliable detection, i.e.,
Pr (O) = Pr (O1) + Pr (O2). (16)
In this case, the asymptotic system outage probability can be
obtained according to the following lemma.

probability achieved by SJ-AS can be approximated as

.
Proof. we can first calculate the term Pr (O1) as
Pr (O1) = Pr (|S2| = 0)=

)
? Pr
(
g(n) > h(n) > x
)
= 1? (Fh(n)(x)? 1)
(
Fg(n)(x)? 1
)
. (19)
By substituting (19) into (18), Pr (O1) is obtained.
We then turn to the calculation of Pr (O2),
Pr (O2) = Pr
(
?g(n

?) < ?ths , |S2| > 0
)
= Pr
(
g(n

?
, |S2| > 0
)
. (20)
Let ?(n) = g(n)b(n) for ?n ? S2. Since b(n) > 0 for ?n ? S2,
the product ?(n
?) = g(n
?)b(n
?) in (20) can be presented as
?(n
?) = max
(
?(n)
)
, for ?n ? S2. (21)
Then Pr (O2) can be further expressed as
Pr (O2) = Pr

By summing (18) and (29), the proof of (17) is completed.
Remark 1: When ? approaches infinity, c1, c2 and ?m,k
approach zero. By using the binomial theorem and the ap-
proximation 1?e?x x?0? x, the system outage probability can
be further approximated as follows:

scheme can realize a diversity of N min (M,K).
Remark 2: The optimality of the proposed SJ-AS is illus-
trated in the following lemma.
Lemma 3. The proposed SJ-AS scheme minimizes the system
outage probability of the considered MIMO CR-NOMA system.
Proof. This lemma can be proved by contradiction. Suppose
there exists another joint AS strategy achieving a lower system
outage probability than SJ-AS. Let
(
n??, m??, k??
)
6= (n?,m?, k?)
denote the antenna triple selected by the new strategy. Accord-
ing to the assumption, it is possible that there is no outage with
(
n??, m??, k??
)
antennas while an outage occurs with (n?,m?, k?)
antennas. In this case, the pair (hn??m?? , gn??k??) must be in |S2|
to satisfy the target SINR of the PU, i.e., |S2| > 0. Recall that
the pair (hn?m? , gn?k?) ? |S2| is selected according to (12) to
maximize ?s. In this case, if the maximized ?s cannot meet
?ths , the antennas selected by other scheme which provides
smaller ?s cannot meet ?
th
s , either. Therefore, one can conclude
that there is NO other joint AS strategies can achieve a lower
outage probability than SJ-AS, which is contradicted to the
assumption made earlier. The lemma is proved.
IV. NUMERICAL STUDIES
In this section, the performance of the proposed SJ-AS
algorithm for MIMO CR-NOMA networks is evaluated by
Monte Carlo simulations. Let ?h = d
?
p (?g = d
?
s), where
dp (ds) is the distance between the BS and PU (SU), and the
path-loss exponent is set as ? = 3.
Fig. (a) and (b) compare the received SNR of the SU and
the system outage performance between SJ-AS and other AS
strategies. As illustrated in both figures, over the entire SNR
region, SJ-AS outperforms the conventional max-min scheme,
in which the antenna selection is executed under the max-
min criteria, i.e., max(min(hnm, gnk)) for all n ? N ,m ? M
and k ? K. Furthermore, the performance of both SJ-AS and
the max-min scheme are much better than that of random
AS, since both SJ-AS and the max-min scheme utilize the
spatial degrees of freedom brought by the multiple antennas
at each node. We also see that the analytical results match the
simulation results for SJ-AS, which validates our theoretical
analysis in Sec. III. Moreover, compared to the optimal ES
scheme, SJ-AS can achieve the optimal outage performance
as discussed in Remark 2, but with significantly reduced
computational complexity. In particular, the corresponding

V. CONCLUSION
In this letter, we studied the joint AS and power allocation
problem for a MIMO CR-NOMA system. A computationally
efficient SJ-AS scheme was proposed, and the asymptotic
closed-form expression for the system outage performance and
the diversity order for SJ-AS were both obtained. Numerical
results demonstrated that SJ-AS can outperform both the con-
ventional max-min approach and the random selection scheme,
and can achieve the optimal performance of the ES algorithm.
