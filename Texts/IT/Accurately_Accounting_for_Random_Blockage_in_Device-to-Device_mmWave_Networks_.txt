Abstract—Millimeter-wave systems are characterized by the
use of highly directional antennas and the presence of blockages,
which significantly alter the path-loss and small-scale fading
parameters. The received power of each interferer depends on
the direction it points and whether it is line-of-sight (LOS),
non-LOS (i.e., partially blocked), or completely blocked. While
interferers that are sufficiently far away will almost certainly
be completely blocked, a finite number of interferers in close
proximity will be subject to random partial blockages. Previous
attempts to characterize mmWave networks have made the
simplifying assumption that all interferers within some radius,
called the LOS ball, are unblocked, while interferers beyond that
radius are non-LOS. However, compared to simulation results,
the LOS ball assumption tends to overestimate outage. In this
paper, we present an accurate yet tractable analysis of finite
mmWave networks that dispenses with the LOS ball assumption.
In the analysis, each interferer has a distribution that is selected
randomly from several possibilities, each representing different
blockage and directivity states. First, the exact outage probability
is found for a finite network with interferers in fixed locations.
Then, the spatially averaged outage probability is found by
averaging over the interferer locations. While the focus is on
device-to-device networks, the analysis is general enough to find
applications outside of the present mmWave framework.
I. INTRODUCTION
Millimeter-wave (mmWave) has emerged in recent years as
a viable candidate for both device-to-device (D2D) communi-
cations as well as infrastructure-based (i.e., cellular) systems
[1–9]. At mmWave frequencies, signals are prone to blocking
by objects intersecting the propagation paths. While the path
loss could be high, it can be compensated through the use
of highly directional antennas, which also helps to isolate
interference. Blocking can significantly impact the distribution
of the small-scale fading (i.e., resulting in a non line-of-
sight state) and if severe enough, cause the signal to be lost
completely (i.e., resulting in an outage state) [2]. The power
of each received signal, whether it be a desired signal or an
interfering signal, is thus highly dependent on the relative
orientations of the transmit and receive antennas and the
presence of objects blocking the paths. Any meaningful anal-
ysis of mmWave systems must therefore account for antenna
orientation and blockage, and typically these are modeled as
appropriate random processes.
An effective methodology to study wireless systems in
general, and mmWave systems in particular, is to embrace the
tools of stochastic geometry to analyze the outage, coverage,
and rate of wireless networks [10]. With stochastic geometry,
the locations of the interferers and blockages are assumed to be
drawn from an appropriate point process. Stochastic geometry
has been applied to mmWave cellular systems in [3–6] and
mmWave D2D systems in [7, 8].
A survey of mathematical models and analytical techniques
is provided in [6] with a section devoted to blockage models.
Random shape theory, which is an offshoot of stochastic
geometry, is applied in [11] to carefully consider blockage
effects. When blocking is modeled as a random process,
the probability that a link is line-of-sight (LOS), i.e., not
blocked, is an exponentially decaying function of link distance.
The distance-dependent blocking probability causes significant
challenges to the application of stochastic geometry. This chal-
lenge can be overcome by making a simplifying assumption
that all interferers within some radius, called the LOS ball,
are unblocked, while interferers beyond that radius are non-
LOS. The LOS ball assumption has been applied to mmWave
cellular in [3, 4] and D2D in [8]. Meanwhile, a two-ball
approximation was applied to mmWave multi-tier cellular sys-
tems in [5]. While it aids tractability, the LOS ball assumption
causes a non-negligible loss in accuracy. For instance, in
[8], the LOS ball approximation caused the distribution of
coverage to be underestimated by a few decibels.
In this paper, we propose an analytical framework for
mmWave networks that explicitly accounts for the blockage
probabilities, thereby dispensing with the need for a LOS ball.
The key to the analysis is to break it into two steps. In the first
step, the interferers are placed in fixed locations and the outage
probability found conditioned on the interferers’ locations.
Each interferer is characterized by a fading distribution that
can take on a plurality of states, depending on the random
orientation of the antennas and random blockage probabilities.
In the second step, the distribution of the outage is found by
taking the spatial average of the conditional outage probability
over the distribution of the interferer locations. Simulation
results confirm the accuracy of the strategy and demonstrate
its superiority over the LOS ball assumption.
The focus of the paper is on D2D networks, whereby the
interferers transmit with a common power in a uniformly
distributed direction. However, the analysis could be extended
to the more complicated case of a cellular network, where each
interferer’s transmit power and direction are correlated with
the location of its serving base station. The analysis is generic
enough that it could find applications outside of mmWave,
such as in the area of frequency hopping [12].
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section
II gives a system model and provides a general problem
formulation. Section III derives an expression for the outage
probability conditioned on the location of the interferers, and
Section IV applies it to a D2D mmWave network. Section
V provides an approach for obtaining the spatially averaged
outage probability. Finally, the paper concludes in Section VI.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider a wireless network with a reference receiver, a
reference transmitter, and K interferers located within some
area A. While the network itself may have an infinite extent
and therefore an infinite number of interferers, we assume that
very distant interferers are fully attenuated and therefore do
not contribute directly to the interference power (though they
could contribute to the noise floor). Only a finite number (K)
of interferers are close enough to contribute to the interference
power, though the contribution of each will depend critically
on whether or not its signal is LOS or non-LOS. Moreover, the
number of interferers K could itself be random. For instance,
if the interferers are drawn from a Poisson point process (PPP),
then the number of interferers in A will be a Poisson variable.
Define the variable S to represent the signal-to-interference
and noise ratio (SINR) at the reference receiver. Our goal is
to find an expression for the outage probability as a function
of an SINR threshold ?, which is the cumulative distribution
function (CDF) of S; i.e, FS(?). The variable S can be
expressed as
S =
Y0
c+
?K
i=1 Yi
. (1)
where c is a constant related to the noise power, Y0 is the
received power of the reference transmitter, and {Yi}, i ?
{1, ...,K}, are the received powers of the K interferers. We
assume that Y0 is a Gamma distributed random variable with
a fixed shaping parameter m0 and scale parameter ?0.
The value of c is selected so that the signal-to-noise ratio
SNR is the mean value of S when the interference is turned
off; i.e.
SNR = E
[
Y0
c
]
=? c =
E[Y0]
SNR
. (2)
The other Yi, i ? {1, ...,K}, each have a distribution that
depends on a variety of factors including the distance to
the interferer, the relative orientations of the transmit and
receive antennas, the random transmission activity (e.g., use
of an Aloha-like protocol), and the blockage process. We thus
assume that each Yi, i ? {1, ...,K}, is drawn from one of J+1
power distributions, each corresponding to a different state that
encapsulates the blockage and directivity conditions. This is
done by drawing a discrete random variable ai ? {0, 1, ..., J},
which indicates the chosen power distribution. Let pi,j rep-
resent the probability that ai = j for i ? {1, 2, ...,K} and
j ? {0, 1, ..., J}. The probabilities {pi,j} could depend on the
location Xi of the i
th interferer. For instance, if a random
blockage model is assumed, then the probabilities associated
with blockage states will be functions of the distance to the
interferer.
Let ai = 0 represent the specific case that the interferer is
turned off (or not using the same resource as the reference
transmitter). It follows that Yi = 0 when ai = 0, and thus
the corresponding power distribution has probability density
function (PDF) fYi(y|ai = 0) = ?(y). Otherwise, when ai >
0, we assume that the variable is Gamma distributed. We define
two functions: m(ai) which describes the shaping parameter
associated with distribution ai and ?(ai) which describes the
scaling factor of distribution ai. The mean of Yi is E[Yi] =
m(ai)/?(ai). To make the notation more compact, we will use
double subscripts for m(·) and ?(·), so that m(ai = j) = mi,j
and ?(ai = j) = ?i,j . Due to path-loss and the orientation
of the reference receiver’s antenna, these functions generally
depend on the location of the ith interferer, which we denote
Xi. It follows that the PDF when ai = j is
fYi(y|ai = j) =
?
mi,j
i,j
?(mi,j)
ymi,j?1e??i,jyu(y) (3)
where u(y) is the unit step function and ?(·) is the Gamma
function.
III. CONDITIONAL OUTAGE PROBABILITY
Assume that the interferers are in fixed locations. From the
theorem on total probability, the PDF of Yi, i ? {1, ...,K},
can simply be found from the weighted sum of the conditional
probabilities.

IV. APPLICATION TO MMWAVE
Consider the mmWave ad hoc network shown in Fig. 1. The
reference receiver (represented by the red star) is located at
the origin, while the K interferers (represented by the blue
dots) are located in an area A, which here is assumed to be
an annulus with inner radius rin and outer radius rout. It is
assumed that a MAC protocol (such as CSMA) prevents any
interference closer than rin to the receiver, while the blockage
is so severe at distance rout that signals beyond that distance
are completely attenuated. Each interferer within A can either
be unblocked, in which case its signal is LOS, or (partially)
blocked, in which case its signal is non-LOS and highly (but
not fully) attenuated.
The transmitter locations Xi are represented by complex
numbers, so that Xi = Rie
j?i , where Ri denotes the distance
from the ith transmitter to the receiver and ?i is the angle from
Xi to the receiver. The reference transmitter (represented by
the red dot) is located at a distance R0 from the receiver, and
in this example, R0 = rin.
Assume that there are K blockages in the network, and
that each blockage is modeled by a disk of width W . We
assume that the number of blockages is the same as the
number of interferers because in an mmWave ad hoc network,
a main source of blockage is human bodies, and if we assume
the interference is due to personal devices (e.g., wearables),
then there will be approximately one interferer per person.
Assuming that the blockages are independent and uniformly
distributed over the annular region, the probability that an
interferer at distance r from the receiver is blocked by any
of the K blockages is given by pb(r). An equation and
derivation for pb(r) is given in [8], and is incorporated herein
by reference.
As in [3, 8], we assume directional antennas that satisfy a
sectorized model. In particular, the antenna gain is G inside the
(half-power) beamwidth ?, and g outside the beamwidth. The
number of antenna elements is N and the relationship between
N , G, g, and ? is given by Table I in [8]. We use subscripts
t and r to distinguish the parameters associated with the
transmitter and receiver antennas, respectively. Thus, Nr is the
number of elements of the receive antenna. The shaded area of
Fig. 1 shows the main beam of the receive antenna. Assuming
a random 2-D orientation for the interfering transmitters, the
probability that an interferer points toward the receiver is ?t2? .
We define J = 4 transmission states corresponding to
whether the interferer is or is not blocked and whether the
interferer is pointing towards or away from the receiver. In
particular, we let ai = {1, 3} when the interferer is blocked
and ai = {2, 4} when it is not, and we let ai = {1, 2} when
the interferer is pointing towards the receiver and ai = {3, 4}
when it is pointing away. Moreover, we assume an Aloha-
like medium access protocol, so that the probability that the
interferer transmits is pt. Thus, the probability of state a0,
corresponding to a non-transmission state, is (1?pt). It follows
that the probabilities of the five states are:
ai =
?

?

?

?t
2?pt
3 with prob. pb(Ri)(1 ?
?t
2? )pt
4 with prob. (1? pb(Ri))(1 ?
?t
2? )pt.
(12)
Each of the above ai implies specific shaping and scale param-
eters for the interferer’s power distribution. In particular, the
value of the shaping parameter mi,j depends on the blockage
state. When the link is blocked, i.e. when ai = {1, 3}, the
shaping parameter is mi,j = mN; otherwise mi,j = mL, where
mL and mN are the LOS and non-LOS shaping parameters,
respectively.
Moreover, the scaling parameter for the ith interferer de-
pends on its distance Ri as well as its state ai, and each state
could have associated with it a different antenna gain and path-
loss exponent. The ?i,j parameter is given by ?i,j = mi,j/?i,j
where ?i,j is the average received power given by
?i,j = gr(?i)gt(ai)R
??j
i , (13)
the receive antenna gain is
gr(?i) =
{
Gr if |?i ? ?0| <
?r
2
gr otherwise
(14)
the transmit antenna gain is
gt(ai) =
{
Gt for ai ? {1, 2}
gt for ai ? {3, 4}
(15)
and ?j = ?N if the link is blocked and ?j = ?L if it is not.
We assume that the reference link is LOS; i.e., m0 = mL.
Because the reference transmitter and reference receiver point
towards one another, ?0 = m0/?0 where
?0 = GrGtR
??0
0 , (16)
and ?0 = ?L.
Example #1: We consider as an example a network of
inner radius rin = 1, outer radius rout = 6, and K = 20
interferers. The length of the reference link is R0 = rin = 1.
The transmitters and receiver have Nt = Nr = 4 antennas. The
width of each blockage is W = 1 and we assume that there
are K such blockages. The shape parameter (i.e., Nakagami-m
factor) for LOS links is mL = 4, while that of non-LOS links
is mN = 1 (i.e., Rayleigh fading). The path-loss exponent for
LOS links is ?L = 2, while that of non-LOS links is ?N = 4.
The probability that an interferer transmits is pt = 0.5, and
the signal-to-noise ratio is SNR = 20 dB.
Fig. 2 shows the outage probability for this example as
a function of SINR threshold ? conditioned on the network
realization shown in the left side of the figure. The outage
probability is found two ways: By using (11), which accu-
rately accounts for the blocking probability, and by using the
LOS-ball approximation, which assumes all interferers within
distance RLOS are LOS and those beyond that distance are non-
LOS [8]. Two values of RLOS are used. The first, RLOS = 4.4
is found by matching moments; i.e., by using criterion 1
of [3]. The second, RLOS = 3.4 is found by selecting the
value of RLOS that generates an outage probability curve that
most closely matches (in a mean-square error sense) the curve
found by the exact analysis. Note that finding RLOS in this
manner is not a sustainable solution because it requires that
the exact probability be first found prior to finding the RLOS
that provides the best fit. Moreover, the best-fit value of RLOS
will change from one network realization to another. Hence,
the purpose of the curve is to give insight into the best one can
do when using the LOS ball assumption, even if an “optimal”
value of RLOS were to be used.

over 100 network realization is plotted by the solid red line.
In addition, simulations were run to confirm the analysis,
and are shown as dots on the figure. For each value of
SNR, the simulation involved drawing 10,000 realizations of
S, where each realization of S required first drawing the
necessary set of ai, i ? {1, ..., L}, and then drawing the
set of Yi, i ? {0, ..,K}. Each dot shows the fraction of
trials whose outage probability is less than the value on the
ordinate. As can be seen, the proposed analytical technique
provides close agreement. Moreover, the figure shows the
superiority of the exact analysis compared to the LOS-ball
assumption, especially when the value RLOS = 4.4 is used.
While RLOS = 3.4 provides a close agreement with the
simulations, finding that optimal value of RLOS required the
exact outage probability curves to first be found and thus its
use does not simplify the overall analysis.
V. SPATIALLY AVERAGED OUTAGE PROBABILITY
The conditional outage probability depends significantly on
the underlying network geometry. Fig. 3 shows the outage
probabilities of 10 realizations of networks with K = 20
interferers located in the annulus of inner radius rin = 1
and outer radius rout = 6. The curves were found using the
analytical expression (11) for a SNR = 15 dB. The figure
illustrates that the outage probability can vary dramatically
for different network realizations.
A commonly accepted way to characterize the outage of
a network of randomly located interferers is the spatially
averaged outage probability, which is found by removing the
conditioning on the network geometry. The spatially averaged
outage probability could be found numerically via simulation.
The simulation would involve randomly generating different
network realizations, and computing the conditional outage
probability of each, then averaging over many such network
realizations. As an example, the solid red line in Fig. 3 shows
the numerical average of the outage probability over 100
network realization. A more sophisticated numerical technique
is given in [13] which does not use simulation and will work
for any arbitrary network topology. However, for more regular
shaped networks (e.g., circular, annular, or confined within a
regular polygon), it is possible to get an analytical, rather than
numerical, solution, as we describe in this section.
Let EX[FS(s)] denote the spatially averaged outage prob-
ability, where the expectation is with respect to X =
(X0, X1, ..., XK). From (11) and the independence of {Yi},
the spatially averaged outage probability can be found as
follows:

If the Xi are independent and uniformly distributed on an
annulus, then the PDF of Ri = |Xi| is fRi(r) =
2?r
|A| for
rin ? r ? rout, and ?i = ?Xi is uniform over (0, 2?). Since
Ri is independent of ?i,
EXi [?i] = ERi,?i [?i] = ERiE?i [?i]. (19)
A key challenge in finding the spatial average is that not
only does the power of each interferer depend on the distance
Ri to the interferer, but the probabilities pi,j can also depend
on the distance. This makes the integral required for spatial
averaging difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate in closed
form. To alleviate this issue, we divide the network |A| into L
concentric rings and assume that for sufficiently small rings the
probabilities pi,j are constant for all interferers in a given ring.
Let T0 = rin, TL = rout and Tk = rin+k?r for k = 0, 1, ..., L
where ?r = rout?rin

Denoting gr(?i)gt(ai) = ?i,j , conditioned on Tk ? Ri ?

Exact Analysis
LOS-Ball with RLOS  = 4.4
LOS-Ball with RLOS  = 3.6
Fig. 4: Spatially averaged outage probability with K = 20 randomly
located interferers and SNR = 20 dB. In addition to the exact values,
the outage found using the LOS-ball approximation and two values
of RLOS are shown. The black dots represents simulation results.
and 2F1(·) is the Gauss hypergeometric function. From (14),
the expected value with respect to ?i in (27), yields equation
(28) at the top of the page.
Example #2: This example uses the same parameters as
Example #1 except now the K = 20 interferers are assumed to
be placed randomly within the annulus. Rather than computing
the conditional outage probability for just one network real-
ization, Fig. 4 shows the spatially averaged outage probability
found using (17) with L = 10. In addition to the exact analysis,
the spatially averaged outage probability is found using the
LOS-ball approximation with two values of RLOS: RLOS = 4.4
corresponding to criterion 1 of [3] and RLOS = 3.6, which is
the value that, on average, provides the best fit to the exact
outage probability. Moreover, the dots on the figure show
the spatially averaged outage probability found by averaging
analytical expression for conditional outage probability (11)
over 100 network realizations. Note that the exact analysis
provides close agreement with the simulation results, while
both values of RLOS result in a discrepancy.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we found analytical expressions that exactly
characterize the outage probability in wireless networks when
the power of each interferer is selected at random. The set
of distributions can correspond to different blockage and di-
rectivity states, making it immediately applicable to mmWave
systems. Expressions were given for a deterministic (fixed)
and random geometries. The work could readily be extended
to process other than BPPs, such as Poisson point processes,
as well as networks of shapes other than an annulus. Due
to space constraints, only a few examples have been shown to
confirm the accuracy of the approach; a more detailed analysis
could use these expressions to provide insight into the role
of various parameters such as the number of interferers (K),
array parameters, channel coefficients, and SNR. While the
focus on this paper has been on mmWave, other applications
are possible related to cellular networks, distributed MIMO
systems, and more elaborate MAC protocols. For instance,
the same methodology could be used to model channel access
schemes with various types of collisions (e.g, full and partial)
each with their own severity and probability.
