Joint Optimization Framework for Operational
Cost Minimization in Green
Coverage-Constrained Wireless Networks
Ganesh Prasad, Deepak Mishra, and Ashraf Hossain
Abstract
In this work, we investigate the joint optimization of base station (BS) location, its density, and
transmit power allocation to minimize the overall network operational cost required to meet an underlying
coverage constraint at each user equipment (UE), which is randomly deployed following the binomial
point process (BPP). As this joint optimization problem is nonconvex and combinatorial in nature, we
propose a non-trivial solution methodology that effectively decouples it into three individual optimization
problems. Firstly, by using the distance distribution of the farthest UE from the BS, we present novel
insights on optimal BS location in an optimal sectoring type for a given number of BSs. After that we
provide a tight approximation for the optimal transmit power allocation to each BS. Lastly, using the
latter two results, the optimal number of BSs that minimize the operational cost is obtained. Also, we
have investigated both circular and square field deployments. Numerical results validate the analysis and
provide practical insights on optimal BS deployment. We observe that the proposed joint optimization
framework, that solves the coverage probability versus operational cost tradeoff, can yield a significant
reduction of about 65% in the operational cost as compared to the benchmark fixed allocation scheme.

I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Today with evolution of various applications based on digital world, the number of UEs and
demand of data traffic are increasing exponentially without any compromise with the serving
coverage quality of the UEs. Regarding improvement in coverage over the field, various works
have been done on deployment strategy of the BSs over the field. The conventional grid model
with all the cells being hexagonal in shape and occupying equal area has been shown to be less
tractable in a practical environment [2]. Although, deployment of BSs based on homogeneous
Poisson point process (HPPP) and BPP is more tractable for satisfying the practical aspects [3],
[4], deterministic deployment of BSs according to distribution of the UEs is more realistic and
has been shown to have better performance [5].
In the modern world, the data traffic increases almost a factor 10 every 5 years [6]. This
causes a huge increment in infrastructure cost every year for meeting the desired Quality of
Service (QoS). This increment in infrastructure causes significant increase in power dissipation
by 16%-20% per year which results in consumption of 180 billion kWh electricity per year,
which is nearly 1% of the world-wide total energy consumption. These huge consumptions of
energy result in carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases emission of nearly 130 million
tons every year [6]. This has led to an indispensable need for QoS-constrained green network
deployment strategies that maximize utility of operational cost incurred in achieving a desired
coverage demand of all the users intended to be served.
A. Related Works
Deployment Models: Currently, most of the literature on deployment of BSs are modeled on
the distribution of BSs and UEs by HPPP for practical environment. In [3], the authors show that
deployment of BSs and UEs by independent HPPP is more tractable and satisfy the practical
aspects than placing the BSs on a grid by conventional methods. A survey on modeling of multi-
tier cellular networks and cognitive networks have been done in [2] using stochastic geometry,
where according to type of the network and Media Access Control (MAC) layers, various point
processes like Poisson point process, BPP, hard core point process, and Poisson cluster process
and their performances have been discussed. However in [4], it was argued that binomial point
process (BPP) is more realistic and practical network model as compared to HPPP. In contrast
to HPPP, in BPP a known and finite number of UEs are distributed in a field. So for better
accuracy, we consider a practical setting where UEs are deployed following a BPP.

Power Allocation: One of the method for reduction of power consumption is to dynamically
turn BSs on/off based on the time and spatial distribution of the traffic load. Various methods
for deciding the sleeping mode of the BSs have been discussed in [7]–[15]. Authors in [7]
and [8] considered the switching of the BSs based on the traffic profile. Whereas in [9], both
the traffic profile and density of the BSs are considered for deciding the switching. Authors
in [10] proposed a switching-based energy saving algorithm, which can achieve energy savings
of up to 80%. However, these works [7]–[10] did not consider any Quality of Service (QoS)
constraint to be met while minimizing the energy cost. Authors in [11] discussed about the
trade off between energy saving and spectral efficiency due to the switching of BSs, and thereby
designed an optimal control mechanism to solve this trade off. In [12], both centralized and
decentralized BS energy saving schemes have been proposed under the constraint of outage
probability. Authors in [13] and [14] investigated the impact of sleep operation on the blocking
probability and delay, respectively. A survey in [15] gives the state of the art on the proposals
for reducing the power consumption at the BSs by implementing sleep operations. Although, the
works in [7]–[15] optimize the BSs densities by efficiently controlling the switching operation,
they have not discussed about the joint optimization of transmit power and location of the BSs.
BS Localization: Energy efficient network designs by optimizing the BSs densities without any
switching of BSs have been studied in [16]–[21]. In [18], an energy efficient network is designed
by optimizing the densities of BSs without any QoS constraint. Whereas in [22], blocking
probability has been taken as a constraint in the network design. The coverage probability
variation with BS density is studied in [16] for optimizing the operational power cost of the
network. In [19], the optimal combination of macro BSs and micro BSs was investigated for
satisfying a minimum data traffic demand. On the similar lines, authors in [17] proved that the
network power consumption can be reduced by finding the smallest set of BSs that can sustain
a given data traffic load. In [20] and [21], the per unit area power consumption of the network
is minimized by optimizing the densities of BSs under the constraint of coverage and data rate.
However, these works [16]–[21] did not consider the transmit power optimization at BSs while
considering the practical deployment constraints.
Operation Cost Minimization: There have been some recent developments [23]–[26] for
improving the operational power cost by optimizing more than one parameter of the network.
In [23], this improvement is achieved by optimizing the BS densities, their transmit power, and
deployment factor of the BSs. A method for reducing the power consumption by optimizing the
4
transmit power, BSs densities, number of BS antennas, and number of UEs per cell in a network,
has been proposed in [24]. Considering the joint optimization of BSs density and transmit power
under the coverage constraint, it was shown in [25] that coverage performance of the system
converges to a fixed value with energy related deployment factor. Authors in [26] first optimized
the location and power allocation at the BSs, and then separately optimized the count and location
of the BSs. Yet, the joint optimization of number of BSs, their transmit power, and location has
not been investigated while incorporating BPP model for UEs.
B. Motivation and Key Contributions
Although most of the works considered the optimization of randomly deployed BS densities,
it has been noted that the deterministic deployment of BS is more realistic and has better
performance [5]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that considers coverage-
constrained operational cost minimization by jointly optimizing the number of BSs, their transmit
power, and locations while considering a realistic BPP for deployment of UEs. Also, the coverage
constraint has been applied to the statistically farthest UE in a cell because each BS takes the
responsibility for coverage of all associated UEs. Key contributions of this work are as follows.
• Considering a realistic environment for UEs deployment, we have formulated a coverage
constraint joint optimization problem for minimization of the operational power cost. Due
to its nonconvex and combinatorial nature, a non-trivial solution methodology is proposed
that decouples the joint problem into three individual optimization problems and provides
an efficient way to obtain the joint optimal solution.
• We have considered both circular and square field deployments for operational cost mini-
mization while satisfying an average coverage demand. Joint optimal solutions are obtained
in each case and the impact of asymptotically high and moderate densities of UEs on the
localization of BSs is also discussed. Further, we have discussed the method to derive the
distribution of the distance between a BS an its associated UE for differently shaped cells.
This distance distribution is used to obtain the coverage probability of the farthest UE from
its BS inside a cell and this result is validated via extensive Monte-carlo simulations.
• For minimization of power cost over the network, first we jointly optimize the sectoring type
involved in the cells generation and the associated location of the BS inside each cell. Here
we have shown that the optimal BS localization is based on the minimization of farthest
point Euclidean distance in each cell.
5
• A tight near-optimal analytical approximation for the optimal power allocation is obtained
as a function of the underlying BS deployment. We have shown via numerical investigation
that this approximation is very tight under practical system constraints and very tightly
matches with the global optimal power allocation for high QoS applications having very
high coverage quality demand.
• With both optimal BSs location and transmit power allocation obtained as a function of
number NB of BSs, we prove that the resulting single variable operational cost is unimodal
in NB . Using this property an efficient iterative scheme is presented to obtain the optimal
number of BSs that in turn yields the optimal BS localization and transmit power allocation
providing the minimized operational cost required to meet the underlying coverage demand
of each UE in the network.
• Numerical investigation is carried out to validate the analysis and gain nontrivial insights on
the impact of various system parameters on the optimized average coverage quality versus
cost incurred trade off. A comparison study of operational cost minimization in the square
and circular fields having same area is also carried out. Finally, to corroborate the importance
of the proposed joint optimization framework, we present its performance comparison
against the benchmark schemes to quantify the achievable reduction in operational cost.
C. Paper Organization
The rest of the paper has been organized as follows. In Section II, we discuss the system
model detailing the network topology, wireless channel and cost models. Based on that, we
obtain an expression for the average coverage probability of the farthest UE in a cell and then
formulate the proposed joint optimization framework in Section III. The optimal BS deployment
strategy is outlined in Section IV. Using this, the tight approximation for optimal transmit power
allocation of BSs along with the optimal number of BSs to be deployed for meeting a coverage
demand are derived in Section V. A method for obtaining the coverage-constrained minimized
operational cost in a square field has been discussed in Section VI. Numerical results validating
the analysis and providing insights on the joint optimal deployment strategy are presented in
Section VII. Lastly, the paper is concluded in Section VIII.

II. SYSTEM MODEL
In this section, we first introduce the considered network topology for deployment of BSs and
UEs over the circular field. Next, we present the channel model adopted for downlink commu-
nication from BSs to UEs. Lastly, the adopted power cost model of the BSs for characterizing
the operational cost is presented.
A. Network Topology
We consider a homogeneous cellular network deployment, where NU UEs form a BPP by their
independent uniform distribution in a circular field. NB BSs are deterministically deployed over
this field for meeting the required average coverage quality for each UE. Under the assumption
of mitigation of interference from intracell and intercell downlink communication, the BSs are
assumed to employ the orthogonal multi-access techniques [27]. Each of the BSs and UEs are
equipped with single omnidirectional antenna and the downlink association of an UE to a BS in a
cell is based on Voronoi-tessellation [28]. Following this, we propose an efficient cell generation
method for the circular field to ensure there are no coverage holes and the distance of the farthest
point in a cell from its BS is reduced maximally. Here, we first divide the circular field into equal
sectors of same angle ?, and then in each sector the BSs are placed along the symmetric line in
the radial direction as shown in Fig. 1. Below we define the two sectoring types considered for
optimal deployment of BSs over the circular field.
7
Definition 1: The cells in a circular field are generated by considering two sectoring M = NB
types. (a) M = mk, where the circular field is divided into k equal sectors (each of angle
? = 2?/k), and in each sector, m BSs are deployed along its symmetric line. (b) M = mk+1,
where the circular field is divided into k equal sectors (each of angle ? = 2?/k) and along with
the placement of a BS at the center of the circular field, m BSs are deployed along its symmetric
line in each sector.
The major difference between sectoring M = mk and M = mk + 1 is that in the later case,
a BS is deployed at the center. All the sectors generated in sectoring M have same properties
because each of them is generated by dividing the circular field in equal angle ? = 2?/k.
Therefore, it is sufficient to investigate the optimized performance of any one of them. The BSs
are deployed along the radial direction in a sector and their locations from the center of the
circular field is given by (a) d = {dj; j ? {i, i + 1, . . . , m}} where i = 1 for M = mk (cf.
Fig. 1(a)) and i = 0 for M = mk + 1 (cf. Fig. 1(b)), where dj is the location of the BS from
the center of the field in jth cell of a sector.
B. Channel Model
The received power from the BS is assumed to face path loss and frequency selective Rayleigh
fading. Thus, if the distance of nth nearest UE from its associated BS in cell i is rn,i, then the
corresponding channel power gain is given by hn,ir
??
n,i , where hn,i is random channel fading
gain following the exponential distribution with unit mean and ? is the path loss exponent. The
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) received at that UE is given by ?n,i =
Pthn,i
?2r?n,i
, where Pt is the transmit
power of each BS and ?2 is the variance of the zero mean additive white Gaussian noise signal
received at each UE. The coverage of the nth nearest UE from the BS depends on whether the
received SNR ?n,i at that UE is greater than the threshold T required for successfully detecting
the information content in the received signal. The coverage probability of the nth nearest UE
from the BS is Pr [?n,i ? T ]. Using it along with the definition of ?n,i, corresponding average
coverage probability is given by:
P n,icov = Ern,i
{

Pthn,ir

? T
]}
=
? ru,i
0
e
?
T?2r?n,i
Pt fn,i(rn,i,di) drn,i, (1)
where Ern,i{·} represents the expectation with respect to the random distance rn,i of nth nearest
UE, fn,i(rn,i,di) is the probability density function (PDF) of rn,i with ru,i as the upper limit
for rn,i, and di = {di?1, di, di+1} is the location of the BSs in (i? 1)th, ith, and (i+ 1)th cells
8
respectively of a given sector of angle 2?/k. We notice that the average coverage probability of
the nth nearest UE from the BS in ith cell depends not only on the location of its own BS, but
also on the location of the BSs in adjacent (i? 1)th and (i+ 1)th cells, because the boundaries
of the cells are determined by the Voronoi diagram. However, in case of 1st and mth (last) cells,
the boundaries along the sector depends only on location of the BSs in 1st, 2nd and (m? 1)th,
mth cells, respectively because, one of their boundaries is fixed along the sector. Now if the
average coverage probability of the farthest UE from the BS in a cell satisfies a given coverage
demand, then statistically it will also be satisfied by the other UEs inside the cell. Hence, in the
proposed analysis, we have applied the average coverage constraint only on the farthest UE in
a cell.
As our main goal is to minimize the operational cost of the BSs required to meet an average
coverage demand, we next present the power cost model for the BS deployment.
C. Operational Cost Model for the BS Deployment
From [25], [29], the power consumption model for a BS to analyze the power dissipation in
downlink transmission is given as:
PBS = NPA
(
Pt
µPA
+ PSP
)
(1 + CPCB) , (2)
where PBS is the total power consumed by a BS which constitutes of (i) transmit power Pt by
the BSs, (ii) power amplifier (PA) efficiency µPA, (iii) total number of power amplifiers NPA,
(iv) power dissipation PSP in signal processing on the data, and (v) cost CPCB due to power
supply, cooling, battery backup and other maintenance costs. This can be further simplified as
linear cost model for a BS as:
PBS = aBPt + bB, (3)
where aB representing the coefficient of power consumption that scales the radiated power and
bB accounting for other consumptions due to signal processing, cooling, and battery backup.
Thus, the total operational power cost is NBPBS [25] and it has to be minimized for enabling
coverage-constrained green communications.
III. PROBLEM FORMULATION
In this section we first obtain average coverage probability of farthest UE as a function of
location of the BSs for a given NB , di, M, and the field dimensions. Later, we present the
mathematical formulation for the joint optimization problem to minimize the operational cost.

A. Average Coverage Probability of the Farthest UE
As discussed in Section II-A, we apply the average coverage constraint on the farthest UE
inside a cell and it depends on the distribution of the distance rfar,i of the farthest UE. Its
cumulative density function (CDF) Ffar,i(rfar,i,di) and PDF ffar,i(rfar,i,di) are given by:
Ffar,i(rfar,i,di) =
NU

(k?1) , (4b)
where Fi(rfar,i,di) is the CDF of rfar,i for an UE associated with i
th cell, fi(rfar,i,di) is the
corresponding PDF, Ai is the area of the i
th cell, and W is the whole area of the circular
field [4]. If the shape of a cell is polygon, then Fi(rfar,i,di) and fi(rfar,i,di) can be obtained
by the method discussed in [30] and if the boundary of the cell has circular arc, then it can be
calculated using appendix A. So, using (1) and (4), the average coverage probability of farthest
UE is given by
P far,icov =
? ru,i
0
e
?
T?2r?
far,i

From (5), it is evident that average coverage probability of the farthest UE in ith cell not only
depends on the location of its own BS, but also depends on the locations of the BSs in its
neighboring (i? 1)th and (i+ 1)th cells in the sector.
B. Optimization Formulation
Now we present the joint optimization framework for finding the optimal number NB of BSs
to be deployed along with their transmit power allocation Pt and locations d inside a sector, that
minimize the operational cost incurred in meeting an average coverage constraint at the farthest
UE in each cell.
(P0): minimize
NB,Pt,d

subject to C1 : P far,icov ? 1? ?, ?i ? I,
C2 : NB = {1, 2, . . . , NB,max},
C3 : 0 ? Pt ? Pt,max,
C4 : 0 ? di ? di,max, ?i ? I,
(6)
where I = {j, j + 1, . . . , m} in which j = 1 for M = mk and j = 0 for M = mk + 1. The
constraint C1 ensures that the average coverage probability of the farthest UE is greater than
10
or equal to an acceptable threshold 1? ? in each cell. Here 0 < ?? 1 is decided based on the
acceptable threshold that enables a minimum required coverage probability. The convex linear
constraints C3 and C4 represent the boundary conditions for Pt and di, respectively. Here, Pt,max
and di,max respectively represent the upper bounds on Pt and and location di of BS in i
th cell.
In general, as (P0) is a nonconvex combinatorial optimization problem due to the presence of
integer variable NB and non-convexity of the objective function and constraints C1 and C2, it
is hard to solve it in its current form. So, we present a nontrivial solution methodology that
effectively solves this problem by decoupling it into three individual optimization problems. We
next obtain the optimal BS deployment strategy for a given number NB of BSs.
IV. OPTIMAL DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY OF BSS
Here we present deployment strategy of BSs over the circular field for a given number NB
of BSs. First, we discuss the optimal BSs deployment when number of UEs in the field is
asymptotically very high. After that we carry forward the discussion for scenarios with moderate
UEs density. Lastly, we demonstrate that optimal deployment strategy of BSs and selection of
sectoring type are based on minimizing the farthest point Euclidean distance in each cell.
A. Asyptotically High Density of UEs
When the number of UEs NU over a finite circular field is asymptotically very high (NU ? ?),
then it can be easily shown that in any sub-field of the field, there will be infinite number of
UEs, i.e., if ?i number of UEs is lying in i
th cell (sub-field) of the circular field, then ?i ? ?
for NU ? ?. Therefore, the CDF Ffar,i(rfar,i,di) of distance of farthest UE from location di
of the BS in ith cell can be expressed as: Ffar,i(rfar,i,di) = lim?i??[Fi(rfar,i,di)]
?i . As CDF
Fi(rfar,i,di) = 1 for rfar,i = ru,i and < 1 for rfar,i = ru,i ? ? (? > 0), the corresponding
probability of lying of farthest UE over the range rfar,i ? (ru,i ? ?, ru,i] is given as:
Pr(ru,i ? ? < rfar,i ? ru,i) = lim
?i??
[Fi(ru,i,di)]
?i ? lim
?i??
[Fi(ru,i ? ?,di)]?i
=1? 0,
(7)
where ? is a very small positive constant (? ? 0+) and ru,i is the farthest point Euclidean distance
from the BS. Using (7), the PDF of the farthest UE can be written as ffar,i(rfar,i, di) = ?(rfar,i?ru,i)
for ?? ?, where ?(·) is a Dirac delta function. Therefore, if number of UEs in a field is very
high, then farthest UE lies at the farthest point Euclidean distance from the BS. So, we determine
the optimal location of the BS by minimizing the farthest point Euclidean distance ru,i from it.

Fig. 2: Deployment of BSs over the circular field with two sectoring types.
The conceptual insight for optimal deployment strategy based on minimization of ru,i can be
better understood by taking an example of sectoring k with m = 1, where one BS deployed in
each sector as shown in Fig. 2(a). Here, the farthest point from the BS in cell i (here i = 1) is
decided among the distances from the three vertices. As out of them, two vertices are at same
distance from the BS due to symmetry, the minimum value of ru,i can be obtained by minimizing
the maximum of the two distances with respect to di, i.e., min ru,i = min
di
max{di, li}. For NB ?
4, the minimum value of ru,i is obtained by li = di which gives min ru,i = li = di =
R
2 cos
(
?
NB
)
and corresponding optimal location d?i =
R
2 cos
(
?
NB
) , where li =
?
d2i +R
2 ? 2diR cos? for a
circular field with radius R and ? = ?/2 = ?/NB, for k = NB. For NB = {1, 2}, it can be easily
shown that min ru,i = R and d
?
i = 0, whereas for NB = 3, min ru,i = R sin ? and d
?
i = R cos?
obtained by
?l2i
?di
= 0.
Generalizing this concept, if the BSs are deployed by sectoring M = mk as shown in Fig. 2(b),
then optimal location of m BSs in each sector is determined by solving min
d
max{d1, l1, l2, . . . , lm},
which after similar simplification like for m = 1, reduces to d1 = li, ?i ? I. On using the
trigonometric relationship of l1, l2, . . . , lm with d1, d2, . . . , dm, respectively, we can find the
minimum value of farthest point Euclidean distance ru,i and corresponding optimal locations
d
? = {d?1, d?2, . . . , d?m} for all BSs. Likewise, we can also find them in sectoring mk+1. In Table I,
we have listed the minimum value of farthest point Euclidean distance ru,i and corresponding
optimal locations d? in second and third column respectively for different sectoring types (upto
sectoring 3k). The computation of optimal sectoring type M? is based on obtaining the global
minimum value of farthest point Euclidean distance ru,i for a given number of BSs NB. In Fig 3,

we have depicted the farthest point Euclidean distance ru,i for different sectoring types (upto
sectoring 3k) using the expressions in second column of Table I. It is perceptible that over a
certain range of NB, one sectoring type has global minimum value of ru,i. For example, if we
compare the expression of ru,i in sectoring k, k + 1, and 2k,

for NB ? 17 and vice versa. Therefore sectoring
k+1 has global minimum value for 4 ? NB ? 17. Similarly, sectoring 2k has global minimum
value for 18 ? NB ? 19, but it cannot take the odd integer value, i.e., NB = 19. So, we have
included it in the range for sectoring k + 1, where ru,i has smaller value than in the range for
sectoring 2k + 1. Likewise, the range of NB for other sectoring type has been given in fourth
column of the table. Although, Fig 3 is depicted for a circular field with radius R = 500 m, it
is effectual for any value of R as it only scales the value of ru,i without affecting the range of
NB for different sectoring types. Note that in sectoring mk, ? = m?/NB whereas for sectoring
mk + 1, ? = m?/(NB ? 1). In Table I, we have listed the contents upto sectoring 3k because
the upper bound of number of BSs NB,max = 35 for our performed experiments.
B. When the Density of UEs is Moderate
Now, we carry out the optimal deployment strategy in a scenario, when number of UEs
NU in the circular field is moderate (finite). Again, if we give an insight on distribution of
distance of farthest UE from the BS in ith cell in which the PDF ffar,i(rfar,i,di) is non-zero for
rfar,i ? [0, ru,i], i.e., the farthest UE distance depends on farthest point Euclidean distance ru,i
from the BS. However, if ru,i gets changed by ? > 0 due to a shift in the location of the BS,

then there is a non-zero probability for an UE to lie in the distance range ru,i to ru,i + ? from
the BS. But, for a given value of NU , the farthest UE distance not only depends on ru,i, but also
on the distribution of area around the boundaries. Therefore, the obtained optimal location d?i
based on minimization of farthest point Euclidean distance ru,i is different from actual optimal
location d?i,act which depends on ru,i as well as the distribution of area around the boundaries. For
better discernment, we take a peculiar instance, when a single BS is deployed over the circular
field as shown in Fig. 4(a). Here, first we find the optimal location d?0 based on minimization
of farthest point Euclidean distance, then a delimited realm around the optimal location d?0
associated with actual optimal location d?0,act of the BS is estimated from which the farthest UE
distance is minimum for a given value of NU , where suffix 0 denotes a single BS is deployed
over the circular field. The realm associated with d?0,act converges to the optimal location d
?
0 with
increment in NU and coincides with it, when NU ? ?.
Now, we will estimate the realm of actual optimal location d?0,act around the optimal location
d?0 based on minimization of farthest point Euclidean distance from the BS. In a circular field,

the farthest point Euclidean distance is minimum when the location d?0 of the BS is at the center.
The delimited realm around optimal location d?0 associated with its actual optimal location d
?
i,act
based on minimization of farthest UE distance from the BS can be estimated by giving an
insight on distribution of area around the boundaries, where the farthest UE is lying with a
probability 1 ? ?, where ? ? (0, 1) is the acceptable threshold. If probability of lying of
farthest UE in the range rfar ? [ru(1 ? q), ru] from d?0 is ? 1 ? ?, then it can be expressed as
[F (ru,d
?
0
)]NU ? [F (ru(1? q),d?0)]NU ? 1??, where F (rfar,d?0), [F (rfar,d?0)]NU are the CDF of
distance rfar of an UE, farthest UE, respectively, d
?
0
= {d?0}, and ru is farthest point Euclidean
distance from the BS. As CDF F (rfar,d
?
0
) =
r2far
r2u
and F (ru,d
?
0
) = 1, after substitution in the
expression, we get q ? 1 ? ?
1
2NU . For NU ? ?, q ? 0, i.e., farthest UE distance is same as
farthest point Euclidean distance ru and d
?
0,act coincides with d
?
0.
Now, we find the realm around the optimal location d?0 associated with actual optimal location
d?0,act of the BS. As the realm of actual optimal location depends on the distribution of area
over the width qru near to boundaries, i.e., higher area implies higher probability of lying of the
farthest UE and vice versa. Therefore, the realm of actual optimal location is nearer to higher
distribution of area near to boundaries for minimization of farthest UE distance. As the fields
taken in our experiments are 2D, we take two mutually orthogonal axis MN and PQ as the
coordinate system for probing the distribution of area around the boundaries and corresponding
realm of actual optimal location from d?0 which is taken as the origin as shown in Fig. 4(a).
Actual location on the axis MN is determined by splitting the field about the orthogonal axis
PQ and then we compare the areas A and B over the width qru on two sides. If A > B,
15
then probability of lying of farthest UE on left side PQ is more than right side. Therefore, for
minimizing the farthest UE distance, the shift will be on left side from d?0 along the axis MN.
Similarly, for A < B, the shift will be on right side. Due to symmetry of the circular field about
the center located at d?0, A = B and so, there is equal probability of lying of farthest UE on two
sides over the width qru which results in no shift along the axis MN. Similarly the shift can
be examined along axis PQ after splitting the field about axis MN which gives zero shift again
due to symmetry property of the circular field in all directions. Therefore, the actual optimal
location d?0,act of the BS coincides with d
?
0 for any value of NU .
In general, if we consider an ith cell in the scenario, when multiple BSs are deployed as shown
in Fig. 4(b), the value of q can be obtained numerically by
?NU
0
(
NU
k
)
(Ai
W
)k(1? Ai
W
)NU?k(Fi((1?
q)ru,i,d
?
i
))k ? ? which is obtained using (4), where Fi(rfar,i,d?i ) is the CDF of distance rfar,i
of an UE from d?i and d
?
i is obtained by minimizing the farthest point Euclidean distance from
the BS in the ith cell. As the field is symmetric about the axis MN and asymmetric about the
orthogonal axis PQ, the shift will be along the axis MN from the location d?i due to the difference
in areas 2A and 2B on two sides, where A and B are the areas of the field over the width qru,i
near to boundaries as shown in Fig. 4(b). If 2A > 2B, then the realm is on left side over the range
d?i,act ? (d?i ? qru,i, d?i ), for 2A > 2B, it is on right side over the range d?i,act ? (d?i , d?i + qru,i) and
no shift for 2A = 2B, i.e., d?i,act = d?i , where d?i,act is actual optimal location over the delimited
realm for a given value of NU in i
th cell. Now, we will do a brief discussion on dependence
of d?i,act on NU and number of angular sectors k. As discoursed before, with increment in NU ,
d?i,act converges to d
?
i and asymptotically coincides with it, when NU ? ?. The angle of a
sector is ? = 2? = 2?
k
, therefore with increment in k, ? decreases which results in decrement
in difference between heights of the rhombus as shown in Figs. 2(b) and 4(b). Therefore, the
difference between the areas 2A and 2B decreases and ideally both are equal, when ? = 0. So,
with increment in k, d?i,act converges to d
?
i due to equal area over the width qru,i on left and
right side. Via extensive simulations, we observe that there is diminishable root mean square
error (RMSE), when the BSs are deployed based on minimization of farthest point Euclidean
distance d?i instead of actual optimal location d
?
i,act based on minimization of farthest UE distance
which has been discoursed in Section VII at an instance scenario. Therefore, in the following
optimization technique, we will take optimal location of BSs based on minimization of farthest
point Euclidean distance for simplicity in calculation.
As the optimal location of BSs in a cell is based on minimum value of farthest point Euclidean
16
distance, the selection of optimal sectoring M? is also based on minimum value of farthest point
Euclidean distance in each cell for a given value of NB as discoursed before in Section IV-A.
V. PROPOSED SOLUTION METHODOLOGY FOR OPERATIONAL COST MINIMIZATION
Continuing with our solution methodology of solving (P0) by decoupling it into three indivi-
dual optimization problems, in this section we find the optimal transmit power P ?t of BSs and their
optimal count N?B . With optimal location obtained for a given number NB of BSs in Section IV,
now we propose a tight approximation for optimal Pt as a function of optimal BS location d
?
and optimal sectoring M? for a given number NB of BSs. Lastly, using these developments, we
discuss the reduction of (P0) to a unimodal single variable optimization problem in NB that can
be solved efficiently to obtain optimal number N?B of BSs, which will eventually give optimal
localization (d?,M?) and transmit power P ?t for N?B BSs.
A. Tight Approximation for Optimal Power Allocation
High QoS applications require very high average coverage probability, i.e., threshold ? is
generally very low in practice. Considering this requirement, from constraint C1, we note that
to ensure an average coverage of atleast 90% (i.e., ? ? 0.1) for any distribution ffar,i(rfar,i,di) of
farthest UE’s distance from its BS in ith cell, the argument
T?2r?far,i
Pt
of the exponential term should
be ? 0.1. As, e?x ? 1?x, ?, x ? 0.1 with a percentage error ? 0.053% and this approximation
error decreases at an exponential rate with decreasing x. Applying this approximation to the
average coverage probability, constraint C1 in (P0) can be rewritten as
P far,icov ? 1?
T?2
Pt
? ru,i
0
r?far,iffar,i(rfar,i,di)drfar,i ? 1? ?, ?i ? I. (8)
Here also, the approximation error is < 0.053% and it reduces exponentially with decrease in
acceptable threshold ?; it reduces to zero, when the coverage requirement is 100%, i.e., ? = 0.
We employ this exponential approximation to obtain a tight approximation for optimal power
allocation P ?t at each BS. Below, C1 is rewritten as an approximate lower bound for Pt at
optimal location d?i .

T?2
?
? ru,i

where d?
i
= {d?i?1, d?i , d?i+1} are the optimal location of BSs in (i? 1)th, ith, and (i+1)th cells,
respectively. Since, the operational cost to be minimized is directly proportional to the transmit
power Pt, we need to allocate just sufficient transmit power that can help in achieving the desired
17
coverage threshold 1 ? ?. With homogeneous network consideration, the power allocation for
all BSs is same and it is obtained by taking the maximum of the power allocations as obtained
by solving (9) at strict equality for each BS. Hence, the tight approximation of optimal power
allocation is given by
P ?t ? max
i

T?2
?
? ru,i
0
r?far,iffar,i(rfar,i,d
?

)drfar,i
}
, (10)
which is a function of number of BSs, their locations, and acceptable threshold ?. With transmit
power for each BS set as P ?t defined in (10), constraint C1 is implicitly satisfied and the value
of optimal P ?t can be obtained by optimizing the locations d
? of the BSs and corresponding
sectoring type M? for a given value of NB .
B. Efficeint Iterative Scheme to Find Optimal Number of BSs
From the developments in Sections IV and V-A, we note that both optimal BS location along
with the corresponding optimal sectoring type and transmit power allocation can be represented
as a function of NB . This reduces the multi-variable constrained joint optimization problem (P0)
to a univariate problem in NB, where NB is a positive integer variable to be optimized. Next,
we show that this reduced problem possesses the global optimality property in NB.
As with increasing NB the area of the cell to be covered under a BS approximately reduces by a
factor of 1
NB
, the resulting distance of the farthest UE from the BS and hence, the transmit power
Pt required to meet the underlying coverage constraint also decrease by a factor of
1
N?B
where
? > 0. Further, the objective function of (P0) is a product of NB and a affine transformation
aBPt + bB of Pt. So on relaxing the integer constraint on NB , we note that NB is a positive
linear function and Pt for a given NB with optimized BS location, as discussed above, is a
nonlinear decreasing convex function of NB because the rate of decrease in Pt is decreasing
with increased NB. Using these results in [31, Table 5.2 and Prop. 3.8], the unimodality of the
objective in NB is proved. The method for determining the optimal number of BSs N
?
B and
corresponding minimum value of the operational cost is outlined in Algorithms 1 and 2 which
are discussed next.
Algorithm 1 outlines a procedure to obtain operational cost as a function f(NB) of the number
NB of BS deployed at optimal locations d
? with optimal sectoring type M? and power allocation
P ?t . Algorithm 1 starts with the calculation of optimal location d
? of BSs and sectoring M? for a
given value of NB , and then determines the optimal power allocation P
?
t at d
? in sectoring M?.
Finally, it returns the operational cost f(NB) at P
?
t for a given value of NB. Using this f(NB),

reduces by a fixed factor of 0.618 after each iteration. The detailed steps followed in finding
N?B are mentioned in Algorithm 2. Since the objective is unimodal in NB and golden section
algorithm is known to have fast convergence for unimodal functions [32], Algorithm 2 finds N?B
in very few iterations, which is also validated via numerical results in Section VII.
VI. OPERATIONAL COST MINIMIZATION IN A SQUARE REGION
As a square field is symmetric along its length and width, the cells are generated without any
coverage hole by dividing the field along its length and width as shown in Fig. 5, where the
length and width are divided into p and q equal segments, respectively, i.e., the number of cells
= pq = NB . The generated cells are square if p = q, otherwise they are rectangle in shape. It is
evident that rectangular and square cells are equally divided by two orthogonal axis along the
length and width with center as its origin, so the optimal location of the BSs are at the center
of the cells for any value of NU (cf. Section IV).
We aim to obtain the condition on p and q for finding the minimum value of farthest point
Euclidean distance from the center. If we relax the integer value of p and q, and set q = p? x
(x ? 0), then farthest point euclidean distance in a cell is ru,c = a2
?
1
p2
+ 1
(p?x)2 , where a
is side length of the square field. Minimum value of ru,c depends on the minimum value of
D = 1
p2
+ 1
(p?x)2 . As NB = p (p?x) ? p =

> 0,
i.e., ru is convex and achieves a minimum value at x
? = 0, i.e., at p = q. But for a given NB ,
20
if p = q is not possible for the integer value of p and q, then NB = pq should be such that
x = |p ? q| must be a minimum possible integer. Next, we discuss about the operational cost
minimization in a square field under two different UEs density scenarios.
A. When the Density of UEs is Asymptotically Very High
As discussed in Section IV, ffar,c(rfar,c) = ?(rfar,c?ru,c) for NU ? ?, where ffar,c(rfar,c) is PDF
of distance rfar,c of farthest UE in a cell of the square field. Here a cell is denoted by a suffix c,
because all the cells are same. Also, we have dropped the location of the BS in the PDF expression
as it is trivial that the BSs are lying at center of the cells. For coverage above 90% (? ? 0.1), the
tight bound of power allocation over the BSs is Pt ? T?
2
?
? ru,c
0
r?far,cffar,c(rfar,c)drfar,c =
T?2
?
r?u,c as
discoursed in Section V-A. For NB = pq, ru,c =
a
2
?
1
p2
+ 1
q2
; therefore, optimal power allocation
in each cell is P ?t =
T?2
?
(
a
2
?
1
p2
+ 1
q2
)?
. Now problem (P0) can be written as:
(P1): minimize
NB
NB
[
cB
(
a
2
?
1
p2
+
1
q2
)?
+ bB
]
subject to NB,max ? NB > 0, Pt,max ? Pt > 0
(11)
where cB =
T?2
?
. The objective function of problem (P1) is unimodal and pseudoconvex with
respect to NB , which can be explained same as the discourse in Section V-B. One of the
method for determining the minimized operational cost is by defining a function f(NB) like in
Algorithm 1 in which first we find the optimal way of division of cells in the square field for
a given value of NB for minimization of farthest point Euclidean distance, i.e., NB = pq such
that |p? q| is a minimum possible integer. Then we can find the P ?t = T?
2
?
(
a
2
?
1
p2
+ 1
q2
)?
and
corresponding operational cost as a output for a given value of NB . Finally using the Algorithm 2,
we can find N?B and optimal operational cost. The drawback of this approach is that we have to
apply Algorithm 2 over whole range of NB ? [1, NB,max] In this case, we can make Algorithm 2
more efficient by reducing the range of NB by a very large factor for the iteration. First we
take those NB values in which NB = p
2 (p = q), then we find closed form solution of optimal
number of BSs N?B,p2 . Lastly, we restrict the range of NB around N
?
B,p2 for the iterative approach
of determining N?B .
For NB = p
2, the problem (P1) can be written as:
(P2): minimize
NB
NB
[
cB
( a?
2NB
)?
+ bB
]
subject to NB,max ? NB > 0, Pt,max ? Pt > 0.
(12)
21
Double differentiation of the objective function of (P1) is ?(??2)cBa
?
N
(?/2+1)
B 2
(?/2+2)
> 0 for ? > 2.
Therefore, the objective function is strictly convex and has global minimum value at N?B,p2 =
a2
2
{
(?/2?1)cB

}2/?
. As N?B,p2 may be a fractional value, the restricted range of NB for iterative so-

range of NB . Next, we will obtain the numerical results of proposed analytical system for
minimization of operational cost.

Now we conduct numerical investigation on the proposed optimization and solution metho-
dology. The simulation parameters considered are: R = 500 m, a = 500

T = ?10 dB, ? = 4, ?2 = ?70 dBm, aB = 5.5, bB = 32 W, Pt,max = 5 W, and NB,max = 35. In
fixed allocation scheme for experiments over the circular field, Pt = 4 W, NB = 35, sectoring
M = k (m = 1), location d1 = 250 m for NB ? 2; d1 = 0 for NB = 1.

A. Validation of Analysis
Firstly, we validate the average coverage probability expression given in (5). For validation,
the simulation results are obtained by first examining 106 random realizations of Rayleigh fading
channel gain for the corresponding received SNR at the farthest UE in a cell to be greater than
?10 dB for a given UE deployment. After that the average of this fraction, for which SNR
? ?10 dB, is taken over the 103 random UE deployments. A closed match between analytical
and simulation as observed in Fig. 6, validates the average coverage probability analysis as
discussed in Section III-A. We also verified the quality of approximation (9) for the average
coverage probability constraint C1 by noting that the corresponding root-mean-square error was
less than 0.018 for NB = 4. As mentioned in Section V-A, this approximation error diminishes
very rapidly with decreasing threshold ?.
From Fig. 6, we also observe that there is not much improvement in the average coverage
probability when two BSs are deployed instead of one BS. This is so because as center is optimal
BS location in both cases, there is no reduction in the distance of the farthest point inside a cell
from its BS on increasing NB from 1 to 2. Through a high improvement in average coverage
probability, when NB is increased from 2 to 3, the improvement margin again decreases for
NB = 4. So, we note that when the cells are generated by dividing the field in angular direction
only, then the reduction rate of farthest point distance from the BS decreases with NB . So, for
higher improvement in reduction of the farthest point distance, we move to higher sectoring
types, where the cells are generated in both angular and radial directions (cf. Fig. 1).
Also, we have validated the proposed CDF in appendix A of distance r of an UE from the

BS in mth cell for sectoring M = mk + 1 where k = 10. It can be observed in Fig. 7 that
the CDF reaches to value 1 at a faster rate for higher m because the farthest point Euclidean
distance from the BSs in each cell is reducing rapidly with m.
Lastly, we investigate the quality of approximation for the optimal BS location based on the
ideology of minimizing the Farthest point Euclidean distance in each cell. In this regards, in
Fig. 8 we have plotted the operational cost performance for (a) BSs localization based on the
minimization the Farthest point Euclidean distance in each cell (called fixed optimal location)
and (b) BSs localization based on the optimal locations (called actual optimal location) as found
by searching in the neighborhood of the ones that minimize the Farthest point Euclidean distance
in each cell (cf. Section IV). As observed in Fig. 8, for both ? = 3 and ? = 4, the operational
cost with fixed optimal location is in close match with the one for the optimal BS location. This
validates our proposal and therefore, hereafter the deployment of BSs based on fixed optimal
location has been taken in our experiments for simplicity.
B. Impact of System Parameters on Operational Cost versus Coverage Demand Trade off
Now, we investigate the impact of channel conditions (? and ?2) on optimal number of
BSs N?B as obtained using the proposed joint optimization. As shown in Fig. 9, generally the
increase in coverage demand, as represented by decreasing ?, results in a significant increase
in N?B . However, for ? = 3 and ?
2 = ?70 dBm that represents the most favorable channel
conditions, N?B = 1 is sufficient for meeting high coverage quality demand with thresholds upto
? ? 4.3× 10?4. For, ? = 3, an increase in ?2 from ?70 dBm to ?50 dBm results in an average

increase of about 5.53 times in N?B . Similarly, when ? increases from 3 to 4 for ?
2 = ?70
dBm, N?B on an average gets increased by 7.6 times. Thus, the optimal BSs requirement N
?
B not
only depends on the coverage quality threshold ?, but is also strongly affected by the channel
conditions ? and ?2.
In Fig. 10, we have plotted the tradeoff between the minimized operational cost and the
underlying average coverage probability requirement 1 ? ? in a circular and square field for
?2 = ?80 dBm. Here, NB and BS locations are jointly optimized for a given Pt value. We
notice that the optimal number of BSs N?B is lower for higher Pt and vice versa. This results
in almost the same cost for the two Pt values, because, for lower Pt, higher number of BSs are
deployed and for higher Pt, N
?
B is relatively lower. As acceptable average coverage probability
increases from 0.9 to 0.9999, the corresponding cost increasing from 40 W to 800 W and from
40 W to 700 W corroborates the utility of the proposed framework for ?? 1 in the circular and
square fields, respectively.
The plots of optimal number of BSs N?B with transmitted power Pt for satisfying the thresholds
? = 10?2 and ? = 10?3 have been shown in Fig. 11. At Pt = 0.25 W and Pt = 5 W, we require
18 and 9 more optimal number of BSs respectively for ? = 10?3 than ? = 10?2. Therefore, the
requirement of more optimal number of BSs on average decreases with increment in Pt and
both the curves will asymptotically converge to N?B = 1 for very high value of Pt.
As shown in Fig. 12, the rate of increment in operational cost with number of UEs NU
increases with increment in coverage demand. Also, we can observe that when the number of
optimal number of BSs N?B is constant with increment in NU , then the optimal transmitted power

C. Performance Comparison Results
In Fig. 13, we have compared the minimized operational cost in a circular and square field
of same area. Initially, they follow each other with respect to NU and the difference gradually
enhances after NU = 40 for satisfying the threshold ? = 10
?3 at ?2 = ?70 dBm as shown in
Fig. 13(a). The minimized operational cost in circular field is 12 W and 148.5 W higher than
in square field for NU = 50 and NU = 170, respectively. But with respect to threshold ?, the

minimized operational cost is almost same for ? ? 0.002 otherwise minor increment in the cost
occurs in circular field for NU = 120 as depicted in Fig. 13(b).
Finally, we conduct a comparison study in the circular field, where the relative performance
of three optimization schemes, (i) ONB: optimal number of BSs for Pt = 4 W, (ii) OPA: optimal
power allocation for NB = 35, and (iii) proposed joint optimization, are compared against the
fixed allocation scheme. The optimization with respect to the BS locations and sectoring type
is considered for all three schemes under different noise power ?2 and acceptable threshold ?
settings. From Figs. 14(a) and 14(b), we note that ONB has better performance than OPA for
?2 ? ?60.1 dBm and ? = {10?1, 10?2, 10?3}, respectively. However, for very high noise power
?2 ? ?60 dBm or for very high coverage demand with ? = 10?4, a large number of BSs are
needed to be deployed. This happens because as OPA is already having very high NB = 35,
which is near optimal for ?2 ? ?60 dBm and ? = 10?4, the optimization with respect to Pt
helps OPA in achieving better performance than ONB for higher noise power scenarios or higher
QoS applications (lower ?). The best performance is undoubtedly achieved by the proposed joint
optimization scheme, which yields an average reduction of about 65% in the operational cost
with varying QoS or coverage demands (represented by varying ?) as compared to the fixed
allocation scheme.

problem into three individual optimization problems. Firstly, insights on optimal BS location and
sectoring type were provided. A tight approximation for transmit power allocation was presented
for high coverage demands with ? ? 0.1. Lastly, the optimal number of BSs was found iteratively
by exploiting the global-optimality in NB. Later, we have extended the methodology in a square
field for finding the minimized operational cost. Numerical results presented insights on the
impact of various system parameters on the tradeoff between the optimized cost and coverage
quality. It is observed that the proposed joint optimization framework, yielding a significant
performance enhancement over the benchmark schemes, can help in the practical realization of
green QoS-aware network operation. Also, a square field has better performance than a circular
field in minimization of the operational cost.
APPENDIX A
DISTANCE DISTRIBUTION IN mth CELL HAVING CIRCULAR ARC SHAPED BOUNDARY
The possible shape of the cells generated by optimally deploying multiple BSs in a circular
field are polygons except mth cell in which one of the boundary is an arc of the circular field as
shown in Fig. 1. Calculation of distance distribution in polygon shaped fields has been discussed
in [30], where all the boundaries are straight-line segment. But, no discussion has been done
in fields associated with a circular arc shaped boundary. Here, we have extended the procedure
in [30] for calculation of distance distribution in mth cell.
Similar to [30], we have divided the mth cell field Wm in four disjoint sub-fields {wj};
j ? {1, 2, 3, 4} about the location dm of the BS associated with each boundaries as shown in
Fig. A.1(a), i.e. Wm = w1 ?w2 ?w3 ?w4. The distance distribution of an UE from the location

dm i.e., the CDF
Aj(r)
Ar(Wm)
and PDF
?Aj/?r
Ar(Wm)
; j ? {1, 2, 3, 4} [33] in each sub-field is computed
individually, where Ar(Wm) is the area of the field Wm and Aj(r) = Ar(C(dm, r) ? wj) is the
area of intersection between the two fields: a bounded circle C(dm, r) with radius r centered
at dm and sub-field wj . Finally, we determine the overall distance distribution over the m
th cell
field Wm by summing all the distance distribution in the four sub-fields, which are given by:
Fm(r,dm) =
1
Ar(Wm)

j=1
Aj(r), fm(r,dm) =

Ar(Wm)

, (A.1)
where dm = {dm?1, dm} is the location of BSs in (m?1)th and mth cells, respectively, Fm(r,dm)
and fm(r,dm) are the CDF and PDF respectively of distance r of an UE from the location dm
of the BS. As the sub-fields w2, w3, and w4 are associated with straight-line segment shaped
boundaries, the computation of distance distribution is same as discussed in [30]. Here we discuss
the computation of distance distribution in the sub-field w1 associated with a circular arc shaped
boundary in a especial scenario, when the BS lie at the symmetric axis of the cell.
For more discernment, we have explored the sub-field w1 in Fig. A.1(b). As the BS always
reside on the symmetric line of the cell, the sub-field w1 is symmetric about the axis OX . The
bounded circle C(dm, r) interact with the boundaries in two discrete ranges r1 ? [0, R ? dm)
and r2 ? [R ? dm,
?
R2 + d2m ? 2Rdm cos ?]. Using trigonometric relationship, the area of the
intersection field A1(r) = Ar(C(dm, r) ? w1) can be computed as:

the CDF Fm(r,dm) and PDF fm(r,dm) respectively of distance r from the location dm of the
BS in the field Wm. Note that in sectoring k, where m = 1, the field Wm has three boundaries
(two straight-line segment and one circular arc), which generates three disjoint sub-fields.
