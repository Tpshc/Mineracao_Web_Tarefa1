Spatial-Mode Diversity and Multiplexing for
FSO Communication with Direct Detection
Shenjie Huang, Student Member, IEEE, Gilda Raoof Mehrpoor, and Majid Safari,
Member, IEEE
Abstract
This work investigates spatial-mode multiplexing (SMM) for practical free-space optical commu-
nication (FSO) systems using direct detection. Unlike several works in the literature where mutually
incoherent channels are assumed, we consider mutually coherent channels that accurately describe SMM
FSO systems employing a single laser source at the transmitter with a narrow linewidth. We develop an
analytical model for such mutually coherent channels and derive expressions for aggregate achievable
rate (AAR). Through numerical simulations, it was shown that there exist optimal transmit mode sets
which result in the maximal asymptotic AAR at high transmitted power. Moreover, in order to resolve
the reliability issues of such SMM FSO systems in the presence of turbulence, a so-called mode diversity
scheme is proposed that can be easily implemented along with SMM FSO systems. It is demonstrated
that mode diversity can significantly improve the outage probability and the ?-outage achievable rate
performance of the multiplexed channels in SMM FSO systems degraded by turbulence.
I. INTRODUCTION
Spatial-mode multiplexing (SMM) in free space optical communications (FSO) is the coun-
terpart of the mode-division multiplexing (MDM) in fibre optics that has recently attracted
more attention [1], [2]. Due to the orthogonality among beams with different spatial modes,
they are proposed to be employed in communication systems to transmit multiple data streams
simultaneously [3]. Similar to the traditional multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO), SMM has
the potential of achieving high degrees of freedom (DOFs) for communication [4]. Recently,
a number of spatial mode sets have been applied in FSO systems such as Laguerre-Gaussian
(LG) beams [5] and Hermite-Gaussian (HG) beams [4]. In particular, numerous works have
been focused on orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes mainly because of the smaller space-
bandwidth product and simpler generation and (de)multiplexing techniques, despite being only
a subset of the complete LG basis [1], [4].

Although theoretically SMM can boost the aggregate capacity, the performance of SMM FSO
systems is impaired by the atmospheric turbulence [3]. After propagation through the atmosphere,
the orthogonality can not be preserved and the reliability of communication might be significantly
degraded [6]. In the long-haul fibre-based MDM communication systems, coherent detection and
MIMO digital signal processing (MIMO-DSP) are usually employed to compensate crosstalk
introduced by mode coupling [7]. Many works on SMM FSO systems also use the same receiver
scheme to mitigate the crosstalk caused by turbulence [8], [9]. However, coherent detection is
quite expensive and is not compatible with the requirement of low cost in practical FSO links
[10]. Moreover, with large number of employed spatial modes the complexity of MIMO receivers
is also an issue even in fibre optic systems, which leads to the partial MIMO or MIMO-free
MDM systems [11]. On the other hand, the application of adaptive optics on SMM FSO systems
are also investigated [12], [13], however, this technique also significantly increases the link costs
especially when large transceiver apertures are employed.
Considering that the receivers with intensity modulation direct detection (IM/DD) are widely
employed in practical terrestrial FSO links due to their simplicity, stability and low cost [10], in
this work we will focus on IM/DD SMM FSO systems. In literature, mutually incoherent channels
are usually assumed in such multiplexing systems to ensure the incoherent power addition
between the intended signal and interference from other channels [3], [14]. With this assumption,
the channel can be described as a linear MIMO channel with a positive-valued channel matrix
and hence traditional MIMO-DSP can be applied to mitigate the crosstalk [15]. Two ways to
realize this incoherent power superposition include generation of different transmitted spatial
modes by distinct lasers with frequency differences larger than the receiver electrical bandwidth
[16]–[18] and using lasers with a linewidth much larger than the receiver electrical bandwidth
[19]. In such cases, the interferometric noise (or beat noise) of the received optical power caused
by the square-law photodetector characteristics can be averaged out and the system shows linear
behaviour in the received optical power [19]. However, in both cases, the additional spatial DOFs
of SMM are achieved in the expense of consuming more spectral DOFs than needed, which could
be exploited through wavelength division multiplexing. Therefore, they do not correspond to an
efficient design of SMM systems that aim to boost the data rate of FSO communication.
In order to simplify the transmitter design and preserve the spectral DOFs, a single laser source
with narrow linewidth can be employed in MDM or SMM systems to generate the transmitted
spatial modes. Since all multiplexed channels are originated from the same source, they are
3
mutually coherent which results in the coherent superposition between the intended optical signal
and the crosstalk at the receiver [17]. Due to the quadratic nature of the photodetectors, the
channel description is now non-linear and traditional MIMO-DSP cannot be employed. Mutually
coherent channels have been investigated especially in MDM systems with multi-mode fibres
(MMFs) and some techniques such as zero-forcing beamforming [15], [20] and optical MIMO
equalizer [21], [22] have been proposed to suppress the effect of crosstalk.
In this paper, we aim to investigate the performance of SMM FSO systems with mutually
coherent channels impaired by both shot noise and thermal noise. Although mutually coherent
channels have been studied in multi-mode fibers [17], [21] and near-field FSO multiplexing
systems [23], to the best of authors knowledge, IM/DD SMM FSO systems with such channels
have not been investigated before. Moreover, by describing the detected signal based on a doubly
stochastic Poisson model, we derive a novel expression for the aggregate achievable rate. In
addition, in order to enhance the reliability of SMM FSO systems cost-effectively, a mode
diversity scheme is proposed and studied.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we introduce channel model for
the investigated multiplexing systems. In Section III, we derive the average aggregate achievable
rate (AAR) for such systems and discuss the optimal transmitted mode set which leads to the
maximal asymptotic AAR at high transmitted power. In Section IV, mode diversity is proposed
for reliability improvement and the corresponding outage performance is presented. Finally, we
conclude this paper in Section V.
II. CHANNEL MODEL
Fig. 1 shows the schematic of the FSO SMM system with mutually coherent channels. At
the transmitter, a single laser source with a narrow linewidth is employed. The electro-optic
modulators (EOMs) are used to modulate N input data streams onto the split beams. The
modulated beams are converted into N orthogonal spatial modes and the multiplexed beam is then
transmitted through the transmitter telescope. At the receiver, the received optical beam is firstly
demultiplexed to separate different spatial modes concerned and these modes are all converted
back to the fundamental Gaussian mode for photodetection. An array of N photodetectors is
used to collect the power in each spatial mode. The (de)multiplexing process can be realized
through diffraction or refraction optics. For instance, spatial light modulator (SLM) [2] and mode
sorter [9] are usually employed in OAM-based FSO systems. Although some (de)multiplexing

techniques can introduce additional power loss to the system, in this work, we assume that this
process is near-perfect and no power loss is introduced as in [3].
Denote the field distribution of the spatial mode with mode state k as uk(r, z) where r
refers to the position vector and z is the propagation distance. Note that uk(r, z) satisfies the
orthonormality condition, i.e., [12]
?
uk(r, z)u
?
k?(r, z)dr =
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
1, if k = k?
0, if k 6= k?
. (1)
If a spatial mode with state k is transmitted through the atmospheric turbulence, the resulting
wavefront on the receiver plane ?k(r, z) can be decomposed using the employed complete
orthonormal spatial mode basis with specific coefficients as [6], [13]
?k(r, z) =
+?
?
i=??
?kiui(r, z), (2)
where the ?ki refers to the coefficient between the transmitted mode state k and the received
mode state i which can be obtained by the inner product
?ki =
?
?k(r, z)u
?
i (r, z)dr. (3)
Note that in general ?ki is a complex value which is related to the instantaneous channel state
[6]. The normalized power leaked from the state k to the state i after propagation through the
atmosphere can be expressed by |?ki|2 [3]. The statistical characteristics of |?ki|2 which depends
on the specific states k and i has been investigated in a few works. For instance, it is concluded
that for OAM modes the self-channel fading, i.e., |?kk|2, obeys Johnson SB distribution and the
crosstalk fading, i.e., |?ki|2 with k 6= i, on the other hand obeys exponential distribution [24].
5
For statistically homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, the distribution of the random phase
distortion is symmetric around the origin with a large variance, therefore it can be approximated
as uniform distribution with high accuracy [25]. Similarly, in this paper the phase of the crosstalk
fading ?ki denoted by 6 ?ki with k 6= i is also assumed to be uniformly distributed within the
interval [0, 2?]. This approximation can be verified numerically under the turbulence conditions
considered here.
Denoting the transmitted mode set as N , the combined transmitted optical field at the transmit-
ter telescope can be expressed as
?
k?N ?kuk(r, 0) where ?k is the modulated optical magnitude
for the transmitted mode state k. We consider that ?k obeys the average power constraint that
E[?2k] = Pt/N where Pt is the totally transmitted average power and N is the number of elements
in the set N . We assume that the transmitter does not have the channel state information so
that the total power is uniformly allocated to all transmitted modes. In addition, the linewidth
of the laser source is assumed to be narrow hence there is no significant relative temporal phase
difference between the transmitted modes [18]. The received optical field over the receiver
telescope can then be written as
?(r, z) =

where z is the propagation distance. After the mode demultiplexing, for the photodetector

where the receiver aperture is considered big enough to collect all the power in the ith mode and
the orthonormality of spatial modes is applied. Note that the effect of the ambient light, which
is considered to be negligible compared to the crosstalk and thermal noise, is not included here.
In (5) the signal and crosstalk are coherently superimposed, thus for the whole SMM system
the vector of the received optical power Y = [y1, · · · , yN ]T can be expressed as
Y = |H?|2, (6)
6
where ? = [?1, · · · , ?N ]T is the vector of the transmitted signal and H is the channel matrix

. (7)
This non-linear transformation between the received optical power Y and transmitted signal
? is due to the square-law optical detection making the traditional MIMO-DSP techniques
inapplicable to this system [17], [21]. It is worth mentioning that unlike the system investigated
here, when mutually incoherent channels are considered (e.g., see [3]), the received optical power
can be written as the incoherent superposition of the signal power and the crosstalk. Hence, the
channel transformation is linear instead which is given by Y? = H???, where ?? = [?21, · · · , ?2N ]T
and

However, as explained before, such a mutually incoherent channel model is valid for FSO
systems that may consume more spectral DOFs than required. We therefore focus on the mutually
coherent channels as also considered in [17], [21].
Denoting the time of postdetection integration as ? which corresponds to the symbol duration,
due to the effect of shot noise, the vector of the detected photon count can be modelled as a
doubly stochastic Poisson process [16] with photon rate vector ? = µY where the coefficient
µ = ??/h?, ? is the quantum efficiency, h is Plank’s constant and ? is optical field frequency.
Note that, in the literature, optical receivers are usually assumed to be either thermal noise or
shot noise limited, however, here we consider a general scenario where both shot and thermal
noise are taken into account [26]. Without loss of generality, we will focus on the multiplexed
channel with mode state i in the following derivation. The same analysis can be easily extended
to other channels in the multiplexing system. Using (5), the photon rate ?i for this channel can
be rewritten by
?i = µ

, (9)
where ?i?ii refers to the signal from intended spatial mode and the summation term is the
interference from other channels. We assume that the receiver has the instantaneous channel
7
state information (CSI) of the amplitude of the signal fading |?ii|, which can be easily estimated
by exciting the mode state i and collecting the received optical power in the same mode [20],
[21]. However, the instantaneous CSI of the interference fading is assumed to be unknown to the
receiver and the receiver only has access to its statistical characteristics. Based on the central limit
theorem [27] and the uniform distribution of 6 ?ki, with the increase of the number of transmitted
modes, the interference term can be approximated as a narrowband complex Gaussian distributed
noise with zero mean and variance ?2c,i on each quadrature where
?2c,i =

E[|?ki|2]. (10)
Note that the expectation of the crosstalk |?ki|2 varies for different transmitted mode k and
received mode i and can be measured at the beginning of the communication. The photon rate
?i in (9) can thus be approximated as a non-central Chi square distributed random variable with

c,i (13)
refers to the average interference photon count and I0(·) is the modified Bessel function with
zero order. With this photon rate ?i, the probability of the detected photon count ni can be
modelled as Laguerre distribution with PDF given by [26]

?(j?) =

. (15)
Based on this characteristic function, the mean and variance of ni are given by
ui = ms,i +mc,i, (16)
?2i = ui +m
2
c,i + 2ms,imc,i.
8
Note that in the expression of ?2i , ui is the shot noise introduced by Poisson photodetection
process and m2c,i+2ms,imc,i results from the fluctuation of the rate ?i itself due to the randomness
of the interference. If we further bring the thermal Gaussian noise into account, the output count
can be expressed as
no,i = ni + nth,i, (17)
where nth,i is Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance ?
2
th = 2kBTo?/RLq
2 [26]. Note that
kB is the Boltzmann’s constant, RL is the load resistance, To is the receiver temperature in
degrees Kelvin and q is the electron charge. The mean and variance of no,i can then be written
as
uo,i = ms,i +mc,i, (18)
?2o,i = uo,i +m

We would like to further emphasize that in this work the channel is modelled based on the
photon counting statistics but the classical Poisson channel model which is commonly employed
in optical communication systems cannot be applied. In fact, in most of the works applying
photon counting analysis, the noise term in the rate of the doubly stochastic Poisson process is
usually introduced by the ambient light with a bandwidth (optical bandwidth) much larger than
the signal electrical bandwidth, as a result a large number of temporal modes of the noise is able
to be detected, which allows the noise randomness to be averaged over all the temporal modes
[16]. Therefore, the variation of the rate is smoothed out and the detected count with Laguerre
distribution can be approximated by a Poisson distribution with high accuracy [28]. However,
in this work the noise term in the rate ?i given in (9) is introduced by the crosstalk from other
channels which has a bandwidth comparable to the signal electrical bandwidth. Therefore only
one temporal mode is detected and the Laguerre count probability cannot be simplified to the
classical Poisson probability.
III. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
A. Aggregate Achievable Rate
The channel model considered in Section II is similar to that of the optical communication sys-
tems impaired by random background noise such as in systems employing optical preamplifiers
[26], [29]. In order to proceed our analysis, the output photon counts no,i can be approximated
9
as a Gaussian distributed random variable with the mean and variance given by (18) as in [26],
[29], [30]. After removing the bias introduced by the average interference photons mc,i, the
channel model can then be rewritten as
no,i = ms,i +
?
ms,iZs,i + Z0,i, (19)
where Zs,i and Z0,i are Gaussian distributed random variables with zero mean and variance
?2Zs,i = 1 + 2mc,i, ?

respectively. The first term in (19) refers to the signal, the second term is the signal/input-
dependent noise which is introduced by the signal-induced shot noise and the fluctuation of
the beat term in (9) due to the random interference, and the third term describes the signal-
independent noise which is introduced by the shot noise caused by the interference, the fluctuation
of the interference and the thermal noise. The exact expression for the capacity of such channel
is unknown, however, its lower and upper bounds under input peak-power and average-power
constraints have been investigated in [31]. In this work, we are interested in the achievable rate
(capacity lower bound) of the SMM systems with a total average-power constraint Pt. Using the
achievable rate given by (23) in [31], for the channel with mode state i in the SMM system, the
achievable rate conditioned on the instantaneous signal fading ?ii can be expressed as

which becomes tighter with the increase of the average transmitted power. The input to achieve
this rate is half-normal distributed with PDF given by

. (22)
Since both of the noise variance ?2Zs,i and ?

Z0,i
contain mc,i which depends on the transmitted
power Pt as shown in (10) and (13), it is expected that with the increase of Pt, the achievable
rate will turn to be interference-limited and saturate at a fixed value. By substituting (10) and
(13) into (21) and after some algebraic manipulations, the asymptotic achievable rate at high Pt
can be achieved as

where ?i is the instantaneous asymptotic signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) given by ?i =

k?N ,k 6=iE[|?ki|2]. Note that (23) is only related to the asymptotic SIR ?i which is
related to the channel state and does not depend on the average transmitted power Pt.
So far we have derived the instantaneous achievable rate for the multiplexed channel with mode
state i in the SMM system. When all channels in the system decode their data independently, the
aggregate achievable rate (AAR) should be considered which is given by the summation of the
achievable rates of N channels, i.e.,
?
i?N Ci|?ii [3]. In order to evaluate the overall performance
of the system, the average AAR is employed as a performance metric which can be calculated
by averaging over the channel states, i.e.,
C = E

. (24)
Considering the complicated achievable rate expression given in (21) and the fact that the
complete statistical characteristics of the signal fading for different spatial modes are not
available, an analytical solution for C is intractable. In the next section we will numerically
calculate C by averaging over a large number of propagation instances generated by simulation
of beam propagation using the random phase screen approach [32]. Moreover, the average
asymptotic AAR can be calculated using

B. Numerical Results
In this section, we present some simulation results for a typical SMM FSO system with
mutually coherent channels, based on our analytical derivations in Section III-A. For the
numerical results, we focus on OAM orthogonal spatial mode set considering that it has attracted
significant interest from scientific community recently [1]. However, we would like to emphasize
that all the analytical derivations in this paper can also be applied to FSO systems employing
other spatial modes such as HG and HB modes.

at the transmitter plane between OAM-based multiplexing employing mutually coherent and
incoherent channels imaged at the transmitter plane. For mutually incoherent channels (Fig.
2(a)), the multiplexed beam intensity is simply the intensity superposition (incoherent addition)
of transmitted modes. However, for mutually coherent channels (Fig. 2(b)), the optical fields are
superimposed (coherent addition) and the multiplexed intensity pattern is more complicated due
to the constructive and destructive interference between modes. Note that the coherent OAM
mode superposition has also been investigated in [33] for high-dimensional modulation.
The propagation of the beams through atmosphere is numerically simulated using the split-
step Fourier method [32] and totally 5 × 104 propagation instances are simulated to ensure
accurate simulation results. The propagation distance is set as z = 1 km, the transmitted beam
wavelength is ? = 850 nm, the quantum efficiency is assumed equal to ? = 1, the receiver
temperature To = 300 K, the local resistance RL = 50 ?, the electrical bandwidth is 1 GHz
which corresponds to a symbol duration of ? = 1 ns and the beamwidth at the transmitter is
w0 = 1.6 cm which leads to the minimum beamwidth on the receiver plane [3]. In practical
SMM systems, the range of spatial modes that can be employed is constrained by the limited
transceiver sizes [4]. In our simulation, the transceivers are designed so that OAM modes with
state ?10 to +10 can be transmitted and received successfully. Moreover, the inner and outer
scales of the turbulence are assumed as l0 = 5 mm and L0 = 20 m, respectively. The phase
screens are placed every 50 m which are randomly generated based on the modified von Karman

R = 0.24, respectively.
In FSO SMM systems, the selection of the transmitted mode set N is essential because of the
different crosstalk characteristics of the spatial modes when propagate through the atmosphere.
In this work, the OAM modes that can be employed for transmission are ranged from ?10 to
+10 and we are interested in the optimal set N that can maximize the average asymptotic AAR
C? under different turbulence conditions. Note that for each channel in the transmitted mode set,
the instantaneous asymptotic achievable rate can be calculated using (23). Fig. 3 plots the optimal
transmitted mode set N with respect to the number of elements N when C2n = 1× 10?15m?2/3
by using exhaustive search. Note that for other turbulence conditions, similar optimal mode sets
can be observed. One can see that the fundamental Gaussian beam with OAM mode i = 0
is always preferable for different N , because this mode has the best ability of keeping the
original mode status after propagating through atmosphere [3]. It is also shown that the relative
separations of the transmitted mode states should be chosen as large as possible. For example,
for three-mode transmission N = 3, the optimal mode set is N = {0,±10} and for N = 5, the
optimal set is N = {0,±4,±10}. This is because at high Pt regime, the multiplexing systems
are interference-limited and those systems with larger mode separation, which indicates smaller
crosstalk between channels and hence larger asymptotic SIRs, can achieve higher AAR. Note

that similar phenomenon is also observed for SMM systems with mutually incoherent channels
[3]. Furthermore, one can also observe from Fig. 3 that when N is odd number, the mode set
N is always symmetrical around the OAM state 0.

in Fig. 4. Note that for each N , the optimal set N is used according to Fig. 3. One can see
that with the increase of N , C? firstly increases and then decreases. This is because when N
is small, the SMM system benefits from the additional spatial DOFs explored by adding more
transmitted modes or channels, hence higher C? can be achieved with the increase of N . Note
that the initial increase of the C? might not be monotonically with respect to N . For instance
when C2n = 1 × 10?15m?2/3, the C? when N = 4 is even smaller than that of N = 3. This
is due to the symmetry and asymmetry of N with respect to the mode state 0 when N is odd
and even, respectively. Actually, Fig. 4 indicates that for small N , the mode sets N with odd
elements are more preferable than those with even elements. On the other hand, adding more
transmitted modes also introduces additional crosstalk to other channels, which degrades the
performance of other channels. Therefore with the further increase of N , the increase of C? due
to the additional DOF might not be able to compensate the additional degradation introduced,
which in turn results in the decrease of C?. As a result, an optimal N exists which can achieve
the maximal C?. For instance, when C2n = 1 × 10?15m?2/3 and C2n = 6 × 10?15m?2/3, the
optimal number of transmitted modes are N = 7 and N = 3 which correspond to the mode sets

N = {0,±2,±5,±10} and N = {0,±10}, respectively. Note that for stronger turbulence, the
optimal number of channels significantly decreases because of the stronger crosstalk effects. The
results shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 are valuable for the design of the practical FSO SMM systems.
Since the transceiver sizes in practical SMM systems limit the range of spatial modes that can
be employed in the system, using the above figures one can select the optimal transmitted mode
set N , which is associated with the turbulence condition, to maximize the average asymptotic
AAR.
The average AAR C given by (24) with respect to Pt for different N is plotted in Fig. 5. Note
that still for each N the optimal set N which results in the maximal C? is chosen according
to Fig. 3. In lower Pt regime, with the increase of Pt, C usually grows much faster for the
systems with larger N than those with smaller N due to the more spatial DOFs they explored.
For instance, by increasing Pt from ?15 dBm to ?10 dBm, an increase of 8.9 nats per channel
use can be observed for N = 5 when C2n = 1 × 10?15m?2/3. However, the corresponding
increments for N = 7 and N = 9 are 9.4 and 10.6 nats per channel use, respectively. In high
Pt regime, the system turns to be interference-limited and C saturates at a fixed value, i.e., C?.
As mentioned before, an optimal number of channels exists which can achieve the maximal
C?. For instance, when C2n = 1× 10?15m?2/3, N = 7 is the number of the transmitted modes
which maximizes C. In Fig. 5(a), one can see that the asymptotic rate for N = 3 is 16.6 nats per
15
channel use. By increasing N to 7, the corresponding rate increases to 17.8 nats per channel use.
However, further increasing N to 9 in turn decreases the asymptotic rate which results in the
rate 16.8 nats per channel use. Similar phenomena can also be observed for stronger turbulence
C2n = 6 × 10?15m?2/3 in Fig. 5(b), however, with this turbulence condition the optimal N is
only 3 and further increasing N will decrease the asymptotic rate at high Pt. In addition, Fig. 5
also indicates that in case of operation at lower Pt regime the optimum number of modes will
increase from that of the high Pt case.
IV. SMM WITH MODE DIVERSITY
A. Mode Diversity
Although mode-multiplexing can significantly increase the aggregated capacity of the FSO
systems, the reliability of each multiplexed channel might be strongly impaired by the turbulence.
Therefore some techniques have to be employed to suppress the effect of crosstalk and
improve the communication reliability. When coherent detection is employed, MIMO-DSP is
commonly employed to mitigate interference effects [34]. However it cannot be applied in
IM/DD SMM systems with mutually coherent channels considered here due to the non-linear
channel transformation. Another method that can be employed is the adaptive optics [12], [13],
which might be too expensive to be used in practical commercial cost-effective FSO links. In
our previous work, zero-forcing beamforming has been investigated in such systems [35]. In
this paper, we propose to use a mode diversity scheme to improve the reliability of the SMM
channels, which is easy to implement in practice and is able to significantly improve the outage
performance. We would like to emphasize that although here we consider SMM FSO systems
with mutually coherent channels, mode diversity can also be used in those systems with mutually
incoherent channels [36].
As mentioned in Section II that after propagation through the atmosphere, the power of the
transmitted modes will leak to other spatial modes. Take OAM mode propagation as an example,
it is concluded that the power in the intended mode is more likely to leak to those OAM
modes with adjacent mode states and this leakage becomes stronger with the increase of the
transmitted OAM mode state [1], [3]. In traditional direct-detection SMM, only the power in those
transmitted modes are detected as shown in Fig. 1 thereby the SMM system can be described
by N multiplexed SISO channels. However, due to the turbulence-induced power leaking, the
received power in modes other than the ones employed for multiplexing might also contain
16

considerable signal power and hence can be used to improve the reliability of the channels by
the means of diversity. The schematic of the proposed receiver with mode diversity is plotted
in Fig. 6. After receiving the incoming optical field, modal demultiplexing is applied. However,
not only the optical power in those modes within the transmitted mode set N is detected, the
optical signals in some other modes are also detected by the photodetector array. The detected
optical signals are then combined together to realize the diversity. With this receiver scheme, the
previous N SISO links in the multiplexing system turn into N SIMO links each with receive
diversity. For instance, for the channel operated on mode state i, denoting the mode set for
diversity as Mi with Mi elements in it, the detected signals in these modes act as diversity
branches and are combined after multiplying by distinct coefficients ?
(i)
j with j ? [1, 2, · · · ,Mi].
It is worth mentioning that in practical SMM systems, one can actually easily get access to the
received signals in numerous spatial modes with small power loss and no additional hardware
complexity by using some well-designed optical devices such as the mode sorter for OAM-based
SMM systems [9]. When mode sorter is employed, the received optical signals in different spatial
modes are transformed into laterally separated and elongated spots, therefore the received signal
in any spatial mode supported by the receive aperture can be collected at different elements of
an already employed integrated detector array.
Taking the channel with the transmitted mode state i in the SMM system as an example, the
detected photon counts in the presence of mode diversity can be expressed as

equal gain combining (EGC) is realized [27]. EGC is attractive due to its ease of implementation
in practice. A more advanced choice of the coefficients that can maximize the SINR can also
be employed here. This optimal combining is called the maximal ratio combining (MRC) and
we will focus on this combining method in the following discussion. According to the Cauchy-

and ? is an arbitrary constant. Equation (34) gives the expression of the coefficients for MRC
which results in the maximal output SINR. Note that different from the MRC in AWGN channel
where the optimal coefficient is simply the fading gain (for real-valued fading) [26], [27], the
optimal coefficient here is related not only to the fading but also to the transmitted signal power
Pt. This is due to the fact that the investigated channel contains signal-dependent noise as
illustrated in (29). Substituting (34) into (33), one can get the maximal SINR as

which is not signal power dependent any more as expected.
B. Diversity Mode Set
So far, we have derived the coefficients for mode diversity with MRC combining. In this
section, we consider the selection of the mode diversity set for each multiplexed channel, i.e., Mi,
which is essential and is directly associated with the reliability improvement. The performance
of MRC combining always benefits from adding more branches, because it is able to adjust
the combining coefficients given in (34), so that the output SINR is the summation of the
branch SINRs. Therefore, the best diversity mode set for each multiplex channel should include
the whole mode states that can be detected. However, increasing the number of combining
branches will definitely make the receiver design as well as the channel estimation process
more complicated. Furthermore, the SINRs of some branches might be very small and make
little contributions to the enhancement of the output SINR. Thus it is valuable to find out the
diversity mode set with least number of branches which achieves relatively high output SINR.
It is known that with the decrease of the correlation of the fadings met by different branches,
better diversity performance can be achieved [37]. Therefore the correlation between the fadings
of combining branches, i.e., |?ij|2, should be considered. Different from the traditional diversity
systems where distinct branches have identical SINR statistical characteristics, the branches in
the mode diversity are inherently different because both the statistics of the signal fading |?ij|2

and the values of the noise variance vary with the received mode state j. Among all of the modes
that can be employed for diversity, the received signal in the mode with the same state as the
transmitted mode, i.e., j = i, is obviously the one with highest average SINR, considering that
the power conserved in the intended mode, i.e., |?ii|2, is usually much larger than that leaks to
other modes, i.e., |?ij |2 with j 6= i. Thus the branch with j = i is the most preferable branch and
can be treated as the dominant one in the proposed SIMO link. Hence the correlation coefficients
between |?ii|2 and the fadings of the other branches |?ij |2 are important.
To see this correlation relationship more clearly, we take the channel with i = 0 in the
OAM-based SMM system as an example. The correlation coefficient between |?ii|2 and |?ij|2
is plotted in Fig. 7 where the transmitted mode state is i = 0. One can see that those received
modes with states closer to the transmitted mode have high inverse correlation. For instance,
the correlation between |?00|2 and |?0+1|2 is ?0.92 when C2n = 1 × 10?15 m?2/3, however,
with the increase of the mode state difference between the transmitted and received modes, the
correlation coefficients increase and approach zero. This is an expected result, because the total
transmitted power is conserved and when the power remained in the intended mode is low, the
transmitted power will more likely be leaked to those modes with adjacent mode states, which
results in high signal power in adjacent modes. As a result, the signal power in adjacent modes
is negatively correlated to the power reserved in the transmitted mode [24]. This correlation
relationship will spread more when the turbulence becomes stronger as shown in Fig. 7 due
to the leakage of the power to more adjacent modes. We would like to emphasize that similar

correlation relationship can also be observed when other spatial modes are transmitted. Based
on the above discussion, one can conclude that the received signals in those modes with states
closer to the transmitted mode state are more preferable to be used for mode diversity because
of the highly negative correlation with the fading of the dominant branch. On the other hand,
for each multiplexed channel in the SMM system, when the mode state of a branch is closer to
that of other multiplexed channels, the power of the crosstalk contained in that branch increases.
As a result, both noise variances ?2
Z
(i)
0,j
and ?2
Z
(i)
s,j
increase and according to (35) the SINR of this
branch decreases and approaches zero. Therefore, it is expected that branches with mode states
close to the transmitted mode state are preferred for mode diversity not only because of higher
diversity gain (due to negative correlation) but also high power gain (due to less crosstalk).
Now we would like to justify our expectation using numerical simulations. In order to
measure the diversity performance properly, we employ the effective fading figure (EFF) which
can quantify the severity of the fading and the effectiveness of diversity systems on reducing
signal fluctuations [38]. EFF is defined as the variance-to-mean-square ratio of the instantaneous
combiner output SINR as
EFF (dB) = 10 log10
{
Var[?i]
(E[?i])
2
}
, (37)
where Var[·] refers to the variance of the random variable. Note that the definition of EFF is
close to the concept of the amount of fading (AF) which is commonly used in literature to assess
the severity of the fading met at the output of a single fading channel [39], [40].

For OAM-based SMM systems, the EFF versus the number of branches for diversity Mi is
plotted in Fig. 8 and 9 for C2n = 6× 10?15m?2/3 and C2n = 1× 10?15m?2/3, respectively. Note
that as in Section III we still focus on the high transmitted power regime, hence the expression
of SINR is given by (36). In addition, the transmitted mode set which maximizes the average
asymptotic AAR is chosen. Since the employed N is symmetrical with respect to state 0, the
EFF of the channels with positive states i are not plotted in the figures for simplicity, which are
the same as the channels with corresponding negative states. Furthermore, for each Mi we plot
the EFF of a diversity mode set Mi which minimizes EFF through exhaustive search. From Fig.
8 and 9 one can see that for every multiplexed channel with the increase of Mi, the EFF firstly
decreases and then saturates on a fixed value. This justifies our expectation that adding branches
is beneficial to the diversity system, however, with the increase of branches, the improvement of
the diversity performance turns to be negligible. In these figures, we also point out the diversity
mode sets with the least elements when the EFFs are saturated. we denote these mode sets as the
best mode sets for diversity in the sense that they can achieve the best diversity performance with
simplest receiver design. One can also see that the elements in the best mode set are all close to
the transmitted mode state. For instance, in Fig. 8 when C2n = 6×10?15 m?2/3 and N = {0±10},
the EFF is ?1.14 dB for the channel with mode i = ?10 in the absence of diversity. With
the increase of the number of modes for diversity, EFF decreases and approaches to a fixed
value ?9.3 dB. The best diversity mode set is given by M?10 = {?10,?9,?8,?7,?6} and
further increase in the number of combining branches can not improve the diversity gain. Note
that the multiplexing channel with i = +10 (which is not plotted in Fig. 8) has symmetrical

best mode set as i = ?10, i.e., M+10 = {+10,+9,+8,+7,+6}. Moreover, one can also
determine the optimal diversity mode set for the channel with i = 0 as M0 = {0,±1}. Note
that according to the simulation, although the channel with i = ?10 benefits more from the mode
diversity with larger EFF reduction, its minimal EFF is still larger than that with i = 0. This is
because the channel with i = 0 is inherently superior to the channel with i = ?10 [3]. Similar
results can also be observed in Fig. 9 when C2n = 1 × 10?15m?2/3 with the transmitted mode
set N = {0,±2,±5,±10}, where the best diversity mode sets are M?10 = {?10,?9,?8},
M?5 = {?4,?5,?6,?7}, M?2 = {?3,?2,?1}, and M0 = {0,±1}.
C. Outage probability
In order to evaluate the reliability improvement provided by the mode diversity, the outage
probability will be investigated in this section. Outage probability is commonly employed in
high-speed FSO communication systems to evaluate the reliability of the link, due to the slow-
varying property of the atmospheric turbulence [41]. It is defined as the probability when the
SINR is failing to achieve a prescribed threshold ?th and can be expressed as
Pout = Pr {?i < ?th} . (38)
The outage probability versus the transmitted optical power with and without the mode diversity
is plotted in Fig. 10 and 11 for C2n = 6× 10?15m?2/3 and C2n = 1× 10?15m?2/3, respectively.

omitted for the sake of clarity. DIV: mode diversity.
For each multiplexed channel, the best mode set for diversity as discussed in Section IV-B is
employed. From these two figures one can observe the significant improvement of the outage
performance by employing the mode diversity. For instance, when C2n = 6 × 10?15m?2/3 and
Pt = ?4 dBm, the outage probability is at a high level of 27% for the channel with i = ±10 in
the absence of mode diversity. However, the corresponding outage probability in the presence of
mode diversity is only 4× 10?4. Similarly, When turbulence condition is C2n = 1× 10?15m?2/3
and seven modes are employed for multiplexing, the outage probability of the channel with
i = ±5 is 0.04 for Pt = ?10 dBm, however, the corresponding outage probability decreases to
1× 10?3 in the presence of mode diversity.
Negative asymptotic slope of error probability or outage probability is usually used to
characterize the diversity order of diversity systems [42]. In SMM systems considered here since
with the increase of Pt the multiplexed channels turn to be interference-limited, error floors will
occur for outage probability curves in high Pt regime. As a result the conventional definition of
diversity order is of no use. However, clear changes can be observed in the negative slopes of
the performance curves at finite Pt when mode diversity is employed. Therefore, one can still
get some insights into the diversity gain using the normalized slopes of the outage probability
curves with respect to that in the absence of mode diversity at finite Pt [42]. For instance, in
24
Fig. 11 one can calculate the normalized slopes as 1.74, 4.98 and 1.42 for multiplexed channels
with i = ±2, i = ±5 and i = 0, respectively when Pt = ?10 dBm. Hence, with this transmitted
power the channels with i = ±5 benefit the most from the mode diversity.
D. ?-Outage Achievable Rate
Finally, let us investigate the achievable rates of the SMM system employing both multiplexing
and mode diversity. The detected photon counts of the channel with transmitted mode state i is
given in (32). After some algebraic manipulations, this expression can be rewritten as
n?o,i = m?s,i +

j given in (34) which maximize the asymptotic output SINR of the SIMO
link, the 1%-outage achievable rate for a three-mode OAM-based SMM system is plotted in Fig.
12. One can observe that using the mode diversity, the outage achievable rate can be significantly
improved especially for the channel with mode state i = ±10. For instance, when Pt = 5 dBm,
the outage achievable rate for i = ±10 is negligible in the absence of mode diversity, however,
when mode diversity is employed, more than 3 nats per channel use outage achievable rate can
be achieved. It is worth mentioning that although the use of combining coefficients given by
(34) can significantly improve the ?-outage achievable rate, these coefficients do not maximize
the receivable rate. Equation (34) is optimal in the sense of maximizing the asymptotic SINR
(36), however, the expression of the achievable rate given in (42) is not a a direct function of
SINR. Thus one might be able to find other coefficients which can achieve even higher ?-outage
achievable rates.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, IM/DD SMM FSO systems with mutually coherent channels are investigated.
Compared to the systems with mutually incoherent channels, the system considered here
employs a single laser source with a narrow linewidth to generate different spatial modes,
26
which simplifies the transmitter design and preserve the spectral DOFs. In order to evaluate the
system performance justifiably, the average AAR is considered. For practical SMM systems, it is
concluded that an optimal transmitted mode set with specific number of modes can be determined
which maximizes the average asymptotic AAR. Moreover, under stronger turbulence, the number
of modes in the optimal mode set decreases accordingly. In order to improve the reliability of
every multiplexed channel in the system, we propose to use a mode diversity scheme which
renders the SISO links in the system into SIMO links. The expression of the optimal combining
coefficients is derived which maximizes the asymptotic SINR and the best diversity mode sets
for different channels are discussed. Through outage performance analysis, it is concluded that
using mode diversity, both the outage probability and ?-outage achievable rate can be significantly
improved. This technique is cost-effective and is a potential technique to improve the reliability
of FSO SMM systems in the future.
