Abstract—One of the most promising approaches to overcome
the uncertainty and dynamic channel variations of millimeter
wave (mmW) communications is to deploy dual-mode base sta-
tions that integrate both mmW and microwave (µW) frequencies.
In particular, if properly designed, such dual-mode base stations
can enhance mobility and handover in highly mobile wireless
environments. In this paper, a novel approach for analyzing and
managing mobility in joint µW-mmW networks is proposed. The
proposed approach leverages device-level caching along with the
capabilities of dual-mode base stations to minimize handover
failures and provide seamless mobility. First, fundamental results
on the caching capabilities, including caching probability and
cache duration, are derived for the proposed dual-mode network
scenario. Second, the average achievable rate of caching is derived
for mobile users. Then, the impact of caching on the number
of handovers (HOs) and the average handover failure (HOF)
is analyzed. The derived analytical results suggest that content
caching will reduce the HOF and enhance the mobility manage-
ment in heterogeneous wireless networks with mmW capabilities.
Numerical results corroborate the analytical derivations and
show that the proposed solution provides significant reductions in
the average HOF, reaching up to 45%, for mobile users moving
with relatively high speeds.
I. INTRODUCTION
The proliferation of bandwidth-intensive wireless applica-
tions such as social networking, high definition video stream-
ing, and mobile TV have drastically strained the capacity
of wireless cellular networks. To cope with this traffic in-
crease, several new technologies are anticipated for 5G cel-
lular systems, including: 1) dense deployment of small cell
base stations (SBSs), and 2) leveraging the large amount of
available bandwidth at millimeter wave (mmW) frequencies
[1]. In fact, SBSs will boost the capacity of wireless networks
by reducing the cell sizes and removing the coverage holes.
Meanwhile, mmW communications will provide high data
rates, by exploiting directional antennas and transmitting over
a large bandwidth that can reach up to 5 GHz.
However, one of the key practical issues associated with
the dense deployment of SBSs is frequent handovers (HOs)
which increases the overhead and delay in heterogeneous net-
works (HetNets). In addition, handover failure (HOF) is more
common in HetNets, particularly, for mobile user equipments
(MUEs) with higher speeds [2]. In fact, due to the small and
disparate cell sizes in HetNets, MUEs will not be able to

of Finland CARMA project.
successfully finish the HO process by the time they trigger
HO and pass a target SBS.
To enhance mobility management in HetNets, an extensive
body of work has appeared in the literature [3]–[11]. One
widely adopted scheme to cope with channel quality variations
in mobile environment is the dynamic adaptive streaming
over HTTP (DASH) protocol. The authors in [3] analyze the
performance of DASH in vehicular networks. In [4], a novel
multi-user DASH protocol is proposed to enhance quality of
experience for MUEs. However, the DASH protocol offers
content segments with different quality (different data rate)
and it selects the content with lower quality when throughput
decreases which results in a lower quality-of-service (QoS).
Therefore, despite its importance, the DASH protocol alone
will not be sufficient to meet the stringent requirements of 5G
applications such as HD TV, uncompressed video streaming,
or virtual reality (VR).
In [5], the authors comprehensively survey mobility man-
agement in IP networks. The work presented in [6] overviews
existing approaches for vertical handover decisions in HetNets.
In [7], the authors analyze the impact of channel fading on
mobility management in HetNets. The work in [8] introduces
an HO scheme that considers the speed of MUEs to decrease
frequent HOs in HetNets. Moreover, the authors in [9] propose
an HO scheme that supports soft HO by allowing MUEs to
connect with both a macrocell base station (MBS) and SBSs.
Furthermore, a distributed mobility management framework
is proposed in [10] which uses multiple frequency bands
to decouple the data and control planes. In [11], an HO
scheme for mmW networks is proposed in which the MBS
acts as an anchor for mmW SBSs to manage control signals.
Although interesting, the works in [5]–[10] do not consider
mmW communications. Moreover, [11] assumes that line-of-
sight (LoS) mmW links are always available and provides no
analytical results to capture the directional nature of mmW
communications.
The main contribution of this paper is a novel mobility man-
agement framework that addresses critical handover issues,
including frequent HOs and HOF in emerging dense wireless
cellular networks with mmW capabilities. In fact, we adopt
a model that allows MUEs to cache their requested content
by exploiting high capacity mmW connectivity whenever
available. Thus, the MUEs will be able to use the cached
content and avoid performing any HO, while passing SBSs
with relatively small cell sizes. In addition, we propose a
geometric model to derive tractable, closed-form expressions
for key performance metrics, including the probability of
caching, cumulative distribution function of caching duration,
and the average data rate for caching at an MUE over a mmW
link. Moreover, we provide insight on the achievable gains
for reducing the number of HOs and the average HOF, by
leveraging caching in mmW-µW networks. Under practical
settings, we show that HOF can be decreased by up to 45%,
even for MUEs moving at high speeds.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
presents the system model. Section III presents the analysis
for caching in mobility management. Performance analysis
are provided in Section IV. Section V presents the simulation
results and Section VI concludes the paper.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider a HetNet composed of an MBS and K SBSs
within a set K, distributed uniformly across an area. The SBSs
are equipped with mmW front-ends to serve MUEs over either
mmW or µW frequency bands [12]. The dual-mode capability
allows to integrate mmW and µW radio access technologies
(RATs) at the medium access control (MAC) layer of the air
interface and reduce the delay and overhead for fast vertical
handovers between both RATs. We consider a set U of U
MUEs that are distributed randomly and move across the
considered geographical area during a time frame T . Each user
u ? U moves in a random direction ?u ? [0, 2?], with respect
to the ? = 0 horizontal angle, which is assumed fixed for each
MUE over a considered time frame T . In addition, we consider
that an MUE u moves with an average speed vu ? [vmin, vmax].
The MUEs can receive their requested traffic over either the
mmW or µW band.
A. Channel model
The large-scale channel effect over mmW frequencies for a
link between an SBS k and an MUE u ? U , in dB, is1
L(u, k) = 20 log10
(
4?r0
?
)
+10? log10
(
ru,k
r0
)
+?, (1)
where (1) holds for ru,k ? r0, with r0 and ru,k denoting,
respectively, the reference distance and distance between the
MUE u and SBS k. In addition, ? is the path loss exponent, ?
is the wavelength at carrier frequency fc = 73 GHz over the E-
band, and ? is a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and
variance ?2. The path loss parameters ? and ? will naturally
have different values, depending on whether the mmW link is
LoS or non-LoS (NLoS). Over the µW frequency band, the
path loss model follows (1), however, with parameters that are
specific to sub-6 GHz frequencies.
An illustration of the considered HeNet is shown in Fig.
1. The coverage for each SBS at the µW frequency is shown
based on the maximum received signal strength (max-RSS)
criteria. In addition, white spaces in Fig. 1 show the areas
that are covered solely by the MBS. Here, we observe that
1The free space path loss model in (1) has been adopted in many existing
works, such as in [1] that carry out real-world measurements to characterize
mmW large scale channel effects.

shadowing effect can adversely increase the ping-pong effect
for MUEs. To cope with this issue, the 3GPP standard suggests
L1/L3 filtering which basically applies averaging to RSS
samples, as detailed in [7].
B. Antenna model and configuration
To overcome the excessive path loss at fc, the MUEs are
equipped with electronically steerable antennas which allow
them to achieve beamforming gains at a desired direction. The
antenna gain pattern for MUEs follows the simple and widely-
adopted sectorized pattern which is given by:
G(?) =
{
Gmax, if ? < |?m|,
Gmin, otherwise,
(2)
where ? and ?m denote, respectively, the azimuth angle and
the antennas’ main lobe beamwidth. Moreover, Gmax and Gmin
denote, respectively, the antenna gain of the main lobe and side
lobes. For MUEs, we use a model similar to the sectorized
pattern in (2). However we allow each SBS to form N beams,
either by using N antenna arrays or forming multi-beam
beamforming. The beam patten configuration of an MBS is
shown in Fig. 2, where N equidistant beams in ? ? [0, 2?]
are formed. To avoid the complexity and overhead of beam-
tracking for mobile users, the location of the SBSs’ beams in
azimuth is fixed. In fact, an MUE can connect to an SBS over
a mmW link, if the MUE traverses the area covered by the
mmW beams of this SBS. It is assumed that for a desired link
between an SBS k and an MUE u, the overall transmit-receive
gain is ?u,k = G
2
max.
C. Traffic model
Video streaming is one of the wireless services with most
stringent QoS requirement. The QoS achieved by such services
is severely impacted by the delay that results from frequent
handovers in HetNets. In addition, HOFs can significantly
degrade the performance by making frequent service inter-
ruptions. Therefore, our goal is to enhance mobility man-
agement for MUEs that request video traffic. Each video
content is partitioned into small segments, each of size B
bits. The network incorporates caching [13], [14] over the
mmW frequency band to store incoming video segments at the
MUE’s storage, whenever a high capacity mmW connection is
available. Considering a cache size of ?u for an arbitrary MUE
u, associated with an SBS k, the number of video segments
that can be cached at MUE u will be
M c(u, k) = min
{
?
R?c(u, k)tcu
B
?
,
?u
B
}
, (3)
where ?.? and min{., .} denote, respectively, the floor and
minimum operands. In addition, tcu is the caching duration
which is equal to the time needed for an MUE u to traverse a
mmW beam at its serving SBS. Considering the small green
triangle in Fig. 2 as the current location of an MUE crossing a
mmW beam, caching duration will be tcu = r
c
u/vu. Moreover,
R?c(u, k) is the average achievable rate for the MUE u during
tcu. Given M
c(u, k) and the video play rate of Q, specified for
each video content, the distance an MUE u can traverse with
speed vu, while playing the cached video content will be
dc(u, k) =
M c(u, k)
Q
vu. (4)
In fact, the MUE can traverse a distance dc(u, k) by using the
cached video content without requiring an HO to any of the
target cells. Meanwhile, the location information and control
signals, such as paging, can be handled by the MBS over the
µW frequency band. Here, we note that buffering segments
which is conventionally used in sub-6 GHz systems can also be
employed within the proposed HO muting scheme. However,
by using buffering, the network can only download a limited
number of segments in advance. In contrast, with caching, an
MUE can store an entire or a large portion of a content. Thus,
by using caching and not just buffering, a mobile MUE will
be able to traverse a longer distance dc, while playing the
stored content. Furthermore, by using the mmW frequency
band, one can leverage the substantial amount of bandwidth
which is suitable to realize the idea of fully-fledged content
caching in practice.
D. Handover procedure and performance metrics
The HO process in the 3GPP standard proceeds as follows
[15]: 1) Each MUE will do a cell search every Ts seconds that
can be configured by the network or directly by MUEs, 2) If
any target cell offers an RSS plus a hysteresis that is higher
than the serving cell, even after L1/L3 filtering of input RSS
samples, the MUE will wait for a time-to-trigger (TTT) of
?T seconds to measure the average RSS from the target cell,
3) If the average RSS is higher than that of the target SBS
during TTT, the MUE triggers HO and sends a measurement
report to its serving cell. The averaging over the TTT duration
will reduce the ping-pong effect resulting from instantaneous
channel state information (CSI) variations, and 4) HO will be
executed after the serving SBS sends HO information to the
target SBS.
In our model, we modify the above HO procedure to
leverage the caching capabilities of the MUEs during mobility.
Here, we let each MUE dynamically determine Ts, depending
on the number of remaining video segments M in the cache,
the video play rate, and the MUE’s speed. That is, an MUE
u will mute the cell search while M/Q is greater than ?T .
In this way, the MUE will have ?T seconds to search for a
target SBS before the cached content runs out.
Figure 2: Antenna beam configuration of a dual-mode SBS with Nk = 3.
Blue shaded areas show the mmW beams.
Next, we consider the HOF as a key performance metric for
an HO procedure. One of the main reasons for the potential
increase in HOF is due to the relatively small cell sizes in
HetNets, compared to the MBS coverage. In fact, HOF occurs
if the time-of-stay (ToS) for an MUE is less than the minimum
ToS (MTS) required for performing a successful HO. That is,
?HOF(u, k) =
{
1, if tu,k < tMTS,
0, otherwise,
(5)
where tu,k is the ToS for MUE u to pass across SBS k
coverage. Although a short ToS may not be the only cause for
an HOF, it becomes critical for small cell setting and MUEs
with high speeds [15]. Next, we adopt a geometric framework
to analyze the caching opportunities, in terms of the caching
duration tc, and the average achievable rate R?c, for MUEs
moving at random directions in joint mmW-µW HetNets.
III. ANALYSIS OF MOBILITY MANAGEMENT WITH
CACHING CAPABILITIES
First, we investigate the probability of serving an arbitrary
MUE over mmW frequencies by a dual-mode SBS.
A. Probability of mmW coverage
In Fig. 2, the small circle shows the intersection of an MUE
u’s trajectory with the coverage area of an arbitrary SBS k. In
this regard, Pck(Nk, ?k) represents the probability that MUE
u with a random direction ?u and speed vu crosses the mmW
coverage areas of SBS k. From Fig. 2, we observe that the
MUE will pass through the mmW coverage area only if the
MUE’s direction is inside the angle A?oB. Hence, we can state
the following.
Theorem 1. If the mmW front-end of SBS k has formed
Nk ? 2 main lobes, each with a beamwidth ?k > 0, the
probability of mmW coverage will be given by:
P
c
k(Nk, ?k)=

[

(

]
. (6)
Proof. See Appendix A. 
We can verify (6) by considering an example scenario with
Nk = 3 and ?k =
2?
3 . For this example, (6) results in
P
c
k(Nk, ?k) = 1 which correctly captures the fact that the
entire cell is covered by mmW beams.
B. Cumulative distribution function of the caching duration
To enable an MUE to use the cached content while not being
associated to an SBS, it is critical to assess the distribution
of caching duration tc for an arbitrary MUE with a random
direction and speed. In this regard, consider the small green
triangle in Fig. 2, which represents the location of an arbitrary
MUE u, xu = (xu, yu) ? R2, crossing a mmW beam. First,
we note that the geometry of a mmW beam for an SBS can
be defined by the location of SBS, as well as the sides of
the beam angle. Without loss of generality, assume that the
SBS of interest is located at the center, such that xk = (0, 0).
Therefore, the two sides of the beam angle will be given by
y = x tan(?0 ? ?k), y = x tan(?0), x > 0. (7)
Assuming that the MUE u is currently located on the angle
side x = y cos(?0??k), as shown by the small triangle in Fig.
2, then ?0 in (7) will be ?0 = arccos
(
xu
ru,k(xu)
)
+ ?k, where
ru,k(x) =
?
x2u + y

u. Hereinafter, we will use the parameter
?0 to simplify our analysis. Let Ftc(.) be the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of the caching duration tc. Thus,
Ftcu(t0) = P(t
c
u ? t0) = P(rcu ? vut0), (8)
where rcu denotes the distance that MUE u will traverse across
the mmW beam, as shown in Fig. 2. Given the location of
MUE xu, the minimum possible distance to traverse, r
min
u , is
rminu =
?
?xu tan ?0 ? yu
?
?
?
1 + tan2 ?0
. (9)
In fact, (9) gives the distance of the point xu from the
beam angle side y = x tan(?0). If r
min
u > vut0, then
Ftcu(t0) = 0. Therefore, for the remainder of this analysis we
consider rminu ? vut0. Next, let x?u denote the intersection
of the MUE’s path with line y = x tan(?0). It is easy
to see that x?u = (xu + r
c
u cos ?u, yu + r
c
u sin ?u). Hence,
yu + r
c
u sin ?u = [xu + r
c
u cos ?u] tan ?0, and r
c
u, i.e., the
distance that MUE u traverses during the caching duration
tc is given by:
rcu = vut
c
u =
yu ? xu tan ?0
tan ?0 cos ?u ? sin ?u
. (10)
Next, from (8) and (10), the CDF can be written as
Ftcu(t0) = P
(
yu ? xu tan ?0
tan ?0 cos ?u ? sin ?u
? vut0
)
. (11)
Using the geometry shown in Fig. 2, we find the CDF of
caching duration as follows:
Lemma 1. The CDF of caching duration, tc, for an arbitrary
MUE u with speed vu is given by

Proof. See Appendix B. 
The CDF of tc is shown in Fig. 3 for different MUE
distances from the serving SBS. Fig. 3 shows that as the
MUE is closer to the SBS, tc takes smaller values with higher

IV. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED
CACHING-ENABLED MOBILITY MANAGEMENT SCHEME
Next, we analyze the average achievable rate for content
caching, for an MUE with speed vu, direction ?u, and initial
distance ru,k(x) from the serving dual-mode SBS. In addition,
we evaluate the impact of caching on mobility management.
A. Average Achievable Rate for Caching
The achievable rate of caching follows

line with length rcu that connects the MUE location x to x

as shown in Fig. 2.
Theorem 2. The average achievable rate for an MUE u served
by an SBS k, R?c(u, k), is given by

k(Nk, ?k)/vut
c, and ?? = ?u ? ?0 + ?k. For
(a) to hold, we set ? = 2 which is a typical value for the path
loss exponent of LoS mmW links [1].
Proof. Theorem 1 implies that with probability 1 ?
P
c
k(Nk, ?k), only µW coverage is available for an MUE.
Therefore, average achievable rate for caching over the mmW
frequencies is given by (14). To simplify (14), we have
ru,k cos ? = ru,k(x) + ru cos ??, ru,k sin ? = ru sin ??, (17)
where ?? = ?u ? ?0 + ?k and ? is an angle between the line
connecting MUE to SBS, ranging from 0 to ?k. Moreover, ru
is the current traversed distance, with ru = r
c
u once the MUE
reaches x? by the end of caching duration, as shown in Fig.
2. From (17), we find ru,k = ru,k(x) sin ??/ sin(?? ? ?). By
changing the integral variable ru to ?, we can write (14) as
R?c(u, k)=?2

where ?1 = ?Pt?(ru,k(x) sin ??)

c
k(Nk, ?k)/vut
c. Next, we can directly con-
clude (15) from (18) by substituting f(?) = sin(????) in (18).
For ? = 2, which is a typical value for the path loss exponent
for LoS mmW links, (15) can be simplified into (16) by taking
the integration by parts in (15). 
B. Achievable gains of caching for mobility management
From (3), (4), and (16), we can find dc(u, k) which is the
distance that MUE u can traverse, while using the cached
video content. On the other hand, by having the average inter-
cell distances in a HetNet, we can approximate the number of
SBSs that an MUE can pass over distance dc(u, k). Hence, the
average number of SBSs that MUE is able to traverse without
performing cell search for HO is
? ?
?
E [dc(u, k)]
l
?
, (19)
where the expected value is taken, since dc(u, k) is a random
variable that depends on ?u. Moreover, l denotes the average
inter-cell distance. Here, we note that
E [dc(u, k)] =
?
?
0
(1? Ftcu(vut))dt, (20)
where Ftc(.) is derived in Lemma 1. We note that (20) is the
direct result of writing an expected value in terms of CDF.
Based on the definition of ? in (19), we can conclude the
following.
Remark 1. The proposed caching scheme will reduce the
average number of HOs by 1/? factor.
Furthermore, from the definition of HOF ?HOF in (5), we
can define the probability of HOF as P(Du,k < vutMTS)
[16], where Du,k = tu,k/vu, and tu,k is the ToS. To compute
the HOF probability, we use the probability density function
(PDF) of a random chord length within a circle with radius a,
as follows:
fD(D) =
2
?
?
4a2 ?D2
, (21)
where (21) relies on the assumption that one side of the chord
is fixed and the other side is determined by choosing a random
? ? [0, ?]. This assumption is in line with our analysis as
shown in Fig. 2. Using (21), we can find the probability of
HOF as follows:
P(Du,k < vutMTS) =

. (23)
In fact, ?HOF is a Bernoulli random variable with a probability
of success that depends on the MUE’s speed, cell radius, and
tMTS. Hence, by reducing the number of HOs by 1/? factor,

V. SIMULATION RESULTS
For simulations, we consider a HetNet composed of K = 50
SBSs distributed uniformly across a circular area with radius
500 meters with the MBS located at the center and a minimum
inter-cell distance of 30 meters. The main parameters are
summarized in Table I. In our simulations, we consider the
overall transmit-receive antenna gain from an interference link
to be random. All statistical results are averaged over a large
number of independent runs.
Fig. 4 compares the average HOF of the proposed scheme
with a conventional HO mechanism that relies on the average
RSS to perform HO and does not exploit caching. The results
clearly demonstrate that caching capabilities, as proposed here,
will significantly improve the HO process for dense HetNets.
In fact, the results in Fig. 4 show that caching over mmW
frequencies will reduce HOF for all speed, reaching up to
45% for MUEs with vu = 60 km/h.
Furthermore, Fig. 5 shows the achievable rate of caching
for an MUE with vu = 60 km/h, as function of different
initial distances ru,k(x) for various ?u. The results in Fig. 5
show that even for MUEs with high speeds, the achievable

the performance. In fact, for NLoS scenarios, the maximum
achievable rate at the distance of 20 meters reduces to 2 Gbps.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have proposed a comprehensive framework
for mobility management in integrated microwave-millimeter
wave networks. In particular, we have shown that by smartly
caching video contents while exploiting the dual-mode nature
of the network’s base stations, one can provide seamless
mobility to the users. We have derived various fundamental
results on the probability and the achievable rate for caching
video contents by leveraging millimeter wave high capacity
transmissions. We have shown that caching provides signifi-
cant gains in reducing the number of handovers. Numerical
results have corroborated our analytical results and showed
that the significant rates for caching can be achieved over the
mmW frequencies, even for fast mobile users. The results also
have shown that the proposed approach substantially decreases
the handover failures in heterogeneous networks.

Given that an arbitrary MUE can enter the circle in Fig. 2
with any direction, it will be instantly covered by mmW with
probability P(xu ? A) = Nk?k2? , where A ?R2 denotes the
part of circle’s perimeter that overlaps with mmW beams.
Thus,

where (25) is resulted from the fact that ?u ? U [0, 2?].
Therefore, from (24) and (25), the probability of crossing a
mmW beam follows (6).
APPENDIX B
From (8), Ftc(t0) = P(r
c
u ? vut0). To find this prob-
ability, we note that rcu ? vut0 if MUE moves between
two line segments of length vut0 that connect MUE to line
y = x cos ?0. Depending on ru,k(x), the intersection of line
segment with y = x cos ?0 may have one or two solutions.
In case of two intersection points, the two line segments
will make two equal angles with the perpendicular line from
xu, to y = x cos ?0, which each is obviously equal to
??(?/2??k)??? = ?/2+?k??? = arccos
(
rminu
vut0
)
. Therefore,
Ftc(t0) =
2
? ? ?k
arccos
(
rminu

)
. (26)
In fact, ?u must be within a range of ? ? ?k for rcu ? vut0
to be valid. Now, if this angle is greater than ?/2 ? ?k, only
one intersection point exists. Equivalently,
Ftc(t0)=
1
? ? ?k

Integrating (26) and (27), the CDF for caching duration can
be written as (12).
