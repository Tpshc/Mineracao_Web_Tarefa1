Abstract—In this paper, we consider a wireless communication
system where a large intelligent surface (LIS) is deployed com-
prising a number of small and distributed LIS-Units. Each LIS-
Unit has a separate signal process unit (SPU) and is connected
to a central process unit (CPU) that coordinates the behaviors
of all the LIS-Units. With such a LIS system, we consider
the user assignments both for sum-rate and minimal user-rate
maximizations. That is, assuming M LIS-Units deployed in the
LIS system, the objective is to select K (K?M ) best LIS-Units
to serve K autonomous users simultaneously. Based on the nice
property of effective inter-user interference suppression of the
LIS-Units, the optimal user assignments can be effectively found
through classical linear assignment problems (LAPs) defined on
a bipartite graph. To be specific, the optimal user assignment
for sum-rate and user-rate maximizations can be solved by
linear sum assignment problem (LSAP) and linear bottleneck
assignment problem (LBAP), respectively. The elements of the
cost matrix are constructed based on the received signal strength
(RSS) measured at each of the M LIS-Units for all the K users.
Numerical results show that, the proposed user assignments are
close to optimal user assignments both under line-of-sight (LoS)
and scattering environments.
I. INTRODUCTION
Large Intelligent Surface (LIS) is a newly proposed wireless
communication system [1], [2] that can be seen as an extension
of massive MIMO [3]–[5] systems, but scales up beyond the
traditional antenna-array concept. As envisioned in [1], [2], a
LIS allows for an unprecedented focusing of energy in three-
dimensional space, remote sensing with extreme precision and
unprecedented data-transmissions, which fulfills visions for the
5G communication systems [6] and the concept of Internet of
Things [7] where massive connections and various applications
are featured. In [1], fundamental limits on the number of inde-
pendent signal dimensions are derived under the assumption
of a single deployed LIS with infinite surface-area. The results
reveal that with matched-filtering (MF) applied, the inter-user
interference of two users at the LIS is close to a sinc-function,
and consequently, as long as the distance between two users
are larger than half the wavelength, the inter-user interference
is negligible.
In practical deployments, compared to a centralized de-
ployment of a single large LIS, a LIS system that comprises
a number of small LIS-Units such as in Fig. 1 has several
advantages. Firstly, the surface-area of each LIS-Unit can
be sufficiently small which facilitates flexible deployments
and configurations. For instance, LIS units can be added,
removed, or replaced without significantly affecting system
design. Secondly, each LIS-Unit can have a separate signal

systems, it can also correspond to a centralized deployment of a single large
LIS, but with partitioning the LIS into a number of independent segments.
process unit (SPU) which makes cable and hardware synchro-
nizations [8] simpler. Thirdly, a distributed LIS-system can
provide robust data-transmission and cover a wide area as
different LIS-Unit scan be deployed apart from each other.
With all these advantages, in this paper we consider optimal
user assignments both for sum-rate and minimum user-rate
maximizations in a distributed LIS-system that comprises M
LIS-Units. The target is to select K (K ?M ) LIS-Units to
serve K autonomous users, with each LIS-Unit serving a user
separately and simultaneously.
Firstly, following the work in [1] we show that, with a
rather small surface-area, each LIS-Unit is effective in inter-
user interference suppression. Hence, the achieved user-rate at
each LIS-Unit can be evaluated by the received signal strength
(RSS) for each of the K users. Secondly, by specifying a
cost matrix whose elements are the RSS at each LIS-Unit for
each user, we can construct a bipartite graph between different
users and LIS-Units. With such a bipartite graph, the optimal
user assignment for sum-rate maximization can be transferred
to a linear sum assignment problem (LSAP), while the min-
imum user-rate maximization can be transferred to a linear
bottleneck assignment problem (LBAP), respectively. Then,
the transferred linear assignment problems (LAPs) are solved
through the well-known Kuhn-Munkres algorithm [9], [10],
and Threshold algorithm [11], respectively. Both algorithms
have time complexities close to O(KM2) and are guaranteed
to converge to optimal solutions [12]–[14]. Lastly, we show
through numerical results that, the proposed user assignments
solved with the LAPs are close to the optimal schemes both for
considered line-of-sight (LOS) and scattering environments.

Unit is located at (xcm, y

m = 0, while users are
located at z>0 and arbitrary x, y coordinates. For analytical
tractability, we assume a perfect LoS propagation and the case
in scattering environments is similar. The kth terminal located
at (xk, yk, zk) transmits data symbol ak with power Pk, which
is assumed to be a Gaussian variable with zero-mean and unit-
variance, and independent over index k. Denote ? as the wave-
length and consider a narrowband system where the transmit
times from users to the LIS are negligible compared to symbol
period which yields no temporal interference. Following [1],
[2], the effective channel sxk, yk, zk(x, y) for the kth user at
position (x, y, 0) at the mth LIS-Unit can be modeled as

The variable ?k,` denotes the RSS for the kth user with `=k,
and the inter-user interference between the kth and `th users
with ` 6=k, respectively.
B. Interference Suppression with the LIS-Unit
Next we evaluate the interference suppression property at
each of the LIS-Units. As shown in [1], when the surface-area
of the LIS is infinitely large, two users can be almost perfectly
separated without interfering each other after the MF process.
However, in practical deployments the surface-area of each
LIS-Unit is limited. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate
the interference suppression ability for a LIS-Unit with a finite
surface-area.
Without loss of generality, we consider two users located in
front of a square-shaped LIS-Unit whose center is located at

rate LIS-Units, with each LIS-Unit serving an individual user simultaneously.

(6)
In [1] we show that, under the condition, zk = z`, L =?
and ? is sufficient small, ?k,` only depends on the distance d
between two user that equals
d =
?
(xk ? x`)2 + (yk ? y`)2 + (zk ? z`)2, (7)
and can be well approximated by a sinc-function. Such a
fact leads to an important observation that, as long as two
users are located at least ?/2 away from each other, ?k,` is
negligible. However, for a finite L, closed-form expression
of (6) seems out of reach and we calculate (6) through
numerical computations. As shown next, we can also see that
with a rather small L, the LIS-Unit is still quite efficient in
suppressing the inter-user interference.
In Fig. 3, we evaluate the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)
for a case where L = 0.51, ? = 0.125 (corresponding to a
carrier-frequency 2.4 GHz) and two users that are uniformly
located in front of the LIS-Unit2, with coordinates ?4 ?
x, y ? 4 and 0 < z ? 8 for both users. We test for 1000
realizations of random user locations and report the empirical
cumulative probability density function (CDF). As can be seen,
in almost 90% of the test cases, the value of 1/SIR is below
-20 dB, which shows that the interference from the other
user is significantly suppressed. The same results can be seen
from Fig. 4 where we set a larger L= 1, in which case the

nates are all in meter (m) in the rest of the paper.
2Assuming the LIS-Unit is implemented with discrete antenna-elements
according to the sampling theory and the spacing between two adjacent
antenna-elements is ?/2, then L = 0.5 and L = 1 corresponds to 64 and
256 antenna elements, respectively.

interference is further reduced and in almost 97% of the test
cases, the SIR is below -20 dB.
Utilizing the effectiveness of interference suppression with
LIS-Unit, we next elaborate on optimal user assignments with
the distributed LIS-system for sum-rate maximization and
minimum user-rate maximization.
III. RSS BASED USER ASSIGNMENTS
A. Optimal user assignments with the LIS
We consider a LIS deployment as in Fig. 1, where M
small LIS-units are deployed distributively forming a large
LIS-system and serve K (K?M ) users simultaneously. The
target is to find K best LIS-Units that maximize the sum-
rate and minimum user-rate, respectively, with each LIS-Unit
serving a user separately.
Denote a set P comprising all the possible assignment
schemes, whose cardinality equals
|P| = M !
(M ?K)!
. (8)
Each assignment p ? P contains K elements with the kth
element p(k) denoting the index of the LIS-Unit which is
selected to serve the kth user. The user-rate achieved with the
mth LIS-Unit equals
Rmk = log
?????1 +
(
?mk,k
)2
N0?mk,k +
K?1?

Finding optimal assignments p? can be formulated as the
following maximization problems, respectively:
Sum-rate: p? = arg max
p?P

k=0
R
p(k)
k , (10)
Minimum user-rate: p? = arg max
p?P
(
min
k
(

))
. (11)
The optimizations (10) and (11) can be solved in a brute-force
manner for a small M . However, when M and K are large
values, the complexity becomes prohibitive, which is not only
because of the cardinality of P , but also the computations
for evaluating all ?mk,` that needs MK
2 operations in (5).
Therefore, suboptimal user assignment algorithms are needed
to simplify the complexities. First, we introduce the RSS based
user assignment to reduce of complexity of evaluating ?mk,`.
B. RSS based user assignment
According to the results shown in Sec. II-B, the interference
power |?mk,`|2 when ` 6= k is negligible compared to the
signal power |?k,k|2 at each of the LIS-Unit. Therefore,
the interference terms |?mk,`|2 can be ignored in (9). Then,
maximizing Rmk is equivalent to maximizing ?
m
k,k, and the
optimization problems can be transferred to the following
simplified problems:
Sum-rate: p? = arg max
p?P
K?1?
k=0
?
p(k)
k,k , (12)
Minimum user-rate: p? = arg max
p?P
(
min
k
(
?
p(k)
k,k
))
. (13)
As only ?mk,k are needed in (12) and (13), the complexity of
evaluating ?mk,k reduces to MK operations.
Note that, although (12) and (13) are formulated from the
LoS scenario, since ?mk,k denotes the RSS at the LIS-Unit
for each user, the optimizations (12) and (13) also valid for
scattering scenarios as explained in the next subsection.
C. The validity of RSS based user assignments with reflections
In scattering environments, the RSS ?mk,k comprises the
signals reflected from different scatters that reach the LIS-Unit.
As we are considering a narrowband system, time-differences
of signals from different scatters when arriving the LIS-Units
are negligible. In Fig. 5, we depict an indoor scenario where
besides the LoS signals from the user, there are also signals
reflected by a surface that reach the LIS-Unit at the same
time. In an ideal case, the reflected signals can be viewed
as LoS signals from an image of the user created by the
reflecting surface, with additional transmit power loss caused
by attenuation [15].
An important observation from Fig. 5 is that, based on the
interference suppressing with the LIS-Unit with MF procedure,
the effective channel from the user and the image user are
almost orthogonal. In more complex scattering environments
with many scattering clusters, signal components from differ-
ent clusters [16] can still be assumed to be orthogonal which
results in coherent RSS addition at the LIS-Units. Therefore,
the RSS ?mk,k is still a valid measurement for representing the
user-rate that can be achieved in scattering environments.
D. Transferred linear assignment problems
With the complexity of evaluating ?mk,` reduced from MK
2
to MK, in a second step we reduce the complexity caused
by the cardinality of P from M !/(M ?K)! to O(KM2). We
first introduce a coefficient matrix W such that the element
wk,m = 1 if the kth user is assigned to the mth LIS-Unit;
otherwise wk,m =0. In order to form LAPs, we define a cost
matrix ? with elements
?k,m = ??mk,k ? 0. (14)
Then, the optimization problems (12) and (13) can be equiv-
alently written as linear sum and bottleneck assignment prob-
lems, respectively, as:
LSAP: min
K?1?
k=0
M?1?
m=0
wk,m?k,m (15)
LBAP: min max
k
(
M?1?
m=0

)

wk,m ? 1, 0 ? m < M (17)
M?1?
m=0
wk,m = 1, 0 ? k < K (18)
wk,m ? {0, 1}, 0 ? k < K, 0 ? m < M. (19)
The optimizations in (15) and (16) under constraints (17)-
(19) can be efficiently solved through graph based algorithms.
We first construct a weighted bipartite graph G = (V ,E)
as depicted in Fig. 6 in the following manner. We let
x = [x0, x1, . . . , xk?1] with each vertex xk representing the
kth user, and y = [y0, y1, . . . , yM?1] with each vertex ym
representing the mth LIS-Unit. Hence, it holds that x?y=?,
and we set V =x ? y and E?x × y is the set of possible
matchings. The weight of each edge (xk, ym) in G is ?k,m.
Following conventional notations of LAP, we make the
following notations. Define labels `(u) for each vertex in graph
G, and a feasible labeling ` : V ? R satisfies the condition
`(xk)+`(ym)??k,m. The neighborhood of a vertex xk is the
set N`(xk) = {ym : `(xk)+`(ym) = ?k,m} with all vertices
ym that share an edge with xk, and the neighborhood of a
set S is N`(S) =?xk?SN`(xk). Let P be a matching of G.

edge (xk, ym) equals ?k,m.
A maximum matching is a matching P such that any other
matching P ? satisfies |P ?| ? |P|. A perfect matching is a
matching P in which every vertex in x is adjacent to some
edge in P . A vertex ym is matched if it is endpoint of edge
in P , otherwise it is unmatched.
With the above notations, we can apply the Kuhn-Munkres
algorithm [10], [12], [13] to find a perfect matching P , i.e.,
solutions of wk,m for LSAP (15), which is guaranteed to reach
a global optimal with a numerical complexity O(KM2) and
summarized in Algorithm 1.

3: If N`(S)=T , update labeling according to:

is an augmenting path. Augment P and go to Step 2. If ym
is matched to some xj , extend alternating tree: S=S?xj
and T =T ?ym, and then go to Step 3.
Further, for LBAP (16) we can also apply the Threshold
Algorithm [12, Ch. 6] to find an optimal solution which is
summarized in Algorithm 2, and has a similar complexity [14]
as Algorithm 1. When M and K are large values, the save
of computational costs of Algorithm 1 and 2 compared to the
brute-force method is significant.
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, simulation results are provided for evaluating
the optimal user assignments with LSAP (15) and LBAP
(16). The optimal user assignments obtained with brute-force
methods to solve the original problem (10) and (11) are also
presented as upper bounds. Further, we average the rates
obtained with all the possible user assignments with size |P|
to serves as lower bounds, which reflect the rates achieved
with random user assignments. We consider both LoS and
scattering scenario, and put a special interested in the rates can
be achieved per m2 deployed surface-area of each LIS-Unit
and per user. In all the tests, we assume all users transmitting
at a transmit power P = 20 dB and a noise power density
N0 =1, if not otherwise explicitly pointed out.
We assume that all LIS-Units have identical square shapes
with identical surface-area L×L m2 each, and are deployed
close to each other to form a large LIS-system with centers
uniformly distributed along the line y = z = 0, and with
the middle LIS-Unit centered at location (0,0,0). Further, we
assume that the users are uniformly distributed in front of the
LIS-Units with coordinates (x, y, z) satisfying ?2 ? x ? 2,
?2 ? y ? 2, and 0 < z ? 4. For all the test scenarios, we
generate 2000 realizations of random user locations.
Note that, although Algorithm 1 and 2 are guaranteed to
reach optimal solutions for solving (15) and (16), there are
still rate-losses compared to the brute-force algorithms due
to the simplification of using RSS in (12)-(13) to replace the
capacities in (10)-(11).
A. The user assignments in LoS scenario
First, we evaluate the user assignment in LoS scenarios,
and consider a LIS-system with M = 7 LIS-Units deployed
on a plane. The sum-rate maximized with solving LSAP (15)
and the brute-force search over (10) are presented in Fig.
7, after normalizing by the surface-area of a LIS-Unit and
the number of users. As can be seen, the proposed user
assignments is quite close to the optimal, and much better
than random user assignments. Furthermore, the achieved rate
per user first increases when the surface-area increases and
then starts to decrease. This is essentially because that, as
the surface-area initially increases, the inter-user interference
suppression improves which in turn improves the achieved
rate of each user. After the inter-user interference suppression
becomes perfect, further increasing the surface-area of each
LIS-Unit decreases the achieved rate per m2 deployed surface-
area as the edge parts of the LIS-Unit provide lower rates
compared to the central parts of the LIS-Unit.
In Fig. 8, the minimum user-rate maximized with solving
LBAP (16) and the brute-force search over (11) are presented.
As can be seen, the proposed user assignments has ?10%
minimum user-rate losses compared to the brute-force search
in this case, due to the fact that, the minimum user-rate is more
sensitive to the user arrangement than the sum-rate. However,
the proposed user assignment has a much lower complexity
than the brute-force, and it still significantly outperforms the
random user assignments.

B. The user assignments with reflections
Next, to evaluate the user assignment performance in scat-
tering environments, we consider a LIS-system with M = 5
LIS-Units deployed on the front wall in a hall, and with
N=2 users randomly located inside the hall. In addition, we
consider the wall reflections and create 5 images for each user
corresponding to the 5 walls except the front wall where the
LIS-Units are deployed according to Fig. 5. The attenuation
is assumed to be ?3 dB for all walls.
In Fig. 9, the normalized sum-rates are presented, and
as can be seen, the conclusions are similar to those drawn
from LoS scenarios except for the cases that L is really
small. This is essentially because that, with small L such as
L?0.3, the inter-user interference suppression is not as good
as LoS scenarios due to the presented 5 images for each user.
Nevertheless, for relatively large L it can be seen that, the
proposed user assignments still work well compared to the
brute-force results.
C. An extension of the RSS based user arrangements
At last we discussion an extension of the proposed RSS
based algorithms. Instead of measuring the RSS ?mk,k over
the whole LIS-Unit for each user, a reduced complexity RSS
measurement is to only measure the RSS at finitely many
discrete positions. An ultimate simplified RSS measurement
algorithm would be only evaluate the RSS at the center of

where ?k,m is the square of distance between the kth user
and the mth LIS-Unit. Clearly, replacing ?mk,k by ??
m
k,k would
degrade the performance of user assignment. However, under
the cases that the users are far away from the LIS-Unit or the
surface-area of the LIS-Unit is sufficiently small compared to
the distances from the users to the LIS-Unit, ??mk,k (multiplying
with the surface-area of the LIS-Unit) is a good estimate of
?mk,k. Therefore, it is of interest to evaluate the performance
degradation in general cases.
In Fig. 10, we evaluate the minimum user-rate maximiza-
tions with the reduced-complexity RSS measurement. We test
a similar case as in Fig. 8 with M=5 LIS-Units with L=0.2
and N=2 users. As can be seen, with simplified RSS ??mk,k, the
minimum user-rate is slightly lower then with the original RSS
?mk,k for large transmit power. The sum-rate maximization is
also evaluated for the simplified RSS, but as the achieved rates
are almost the same with ??mk,k and ?
m
k,k, they are not presented.
Nevertheless, the results in Fig. 10 shows the potential to
evaluate the RSS at a number of sampled discrete points on the
LIS-Unit (or even only at the center), which can significantly
simplify the complexity of computing ?mk,k.
V. SUMMARY
We have considered optimal user assignments for a dis-
tributed large intelligent surface (LIS) system with M separate
LIS-Units. The objective is to select K best LIS-Units to serve
K (K?M ) autonomous users simultaneously. By construct-
ing a cost matrix based on the received signal strength (RSS)
at each LIS-Unit for each user, we obtain a weighted bipartite
graph between the K users and M LIS-Units. Utilizing the
effectiveness of LIS-Unit in inter-user interference suppression
and with the constructed bipartite graph, the optimal user
assignments for sum-rate maximization can be transferred
to a linear sum assignment problem (LSAP), and for the
minimum user-rate maximization can be transferred to a linear
bottleneck assignment problem (LBAP), respectively. The lin-
ear assignment problems (LAPs) are then solved through the
classical Kuhn-Munkres and Threshold algorithms with time
complexities O(KM2). We show through numerical results
that, the proposed user assignments perform close to the
optimal assignments both for considered line-of-sight (LoS)
and scattering environments.
