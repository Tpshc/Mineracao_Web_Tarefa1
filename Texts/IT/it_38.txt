Abstract
In this work, we consider a scenario where two multiple-aperture legitimate nodes (Alice and Bob)
communicate by means of Free-Space Optical (FSO) communication in the presence of a multiple-
aperture eavesdropper (Eve), which is subject to pointing errors. Two different schemes are considered
depending on the availability of channel state information (CSI) at Alice: i) the adaptive scheme,
where Alice possesses the instantaneous CSI with respect to Bob; ii) the fixed-rate scheme, where such
information is not available at Alice. The performance of the aforementioned schemes is evaluated in
terms of a recently proposed metric named effective secrecy throughput (EST), which encompasses both
the reliability and secrecy constraints. By constraining the system to operate below a given maximum
allowed secrecy outage probability, we evaluate the EST analytically and through numerical results,
showing that the use of multiple apertures at Alice is very important towards achieving the optimal
EST.

I. INTRODUCTION
A secure communication in the presence of an eavesdropper is a classical problem in communi-
cation theory, which was first analyzed in the context of the wiretap channel in [1]. The motivation
behind the first studies was the possibility of wiretapping through the use of compromising
electrical emanations of copper-wired links or physical wire-tapping [2]. Motivated by the
broadcast nature of radio-frequency (RF) wireless channels, recently, physical layer security
has appeared as a complement to the cryptographic techniques in such channels [3], showing
that the fading, initially seen as a negative factor in terms of reliability, can be used to increase
the data security.
Even though the security in free-space optical (FSO) transmissions is intrinsically higher than
that seen in RF transmissions due to the high directionality of optical beams, the interception
of optical signals is also possible and efforts must be expended aiming to avoid it. In order to
intercept the legitimate link, two main threat scenarios can be distinguished: i) The eavesdropper
(Eve) is close to the legitimate transmitter (Alice) and blocks the laser beam in order to collect
a large amount of power; ii) Eve is close to the legitimate receiver (Bob) and, thus, receives part
of the signal intended for Bob due to the beam radiation being reflected by small particles. The
second case is more reasonable as a real threat scenario since, if Eve is close to Alice, she will
not be able to intercept the beam without blocking the line of sight, which could allow Alice
to detect its presence visually or based on the variation of the received power experienced by
Bob [2].
Similarly to networks without secrecy constraints, the secrecy capacity in FSO communications
is directly influenced by the channel conditions. In order to obtain a nonzero secrecy capacity,
the instantaneous channel quality of the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair must be better than
that seen at the eavesdropper, resulting in an instantaneous channel capacity of the legitimate
link, CB, greater than the channel capacity seen between Alice and Eve, CE. In order to achieve
the secrecy capacity, one can use wiretap codes [4], in which the rate of redundancy is defined
as RE = RB ?R, where R represents the target secrecy rate and RB corresponds to the rate of
transmitted codewords. In order to achieve reliable and secure communications, one must meet
two requirements: i) RB ? CB (reliability constraint); ii) RE > CE (secrecy constraint). Thus,
Alice must have instantaneous channel state information (CSI) with respect to both Eve and
Bob [5], which is not a realistic assumption since, usually, the CSI with respect to Eve is not
3
available at Alice and, therefore, the condition RE > CE cannot be guaranteed at all times. In this
particular case, one must resort to a probabilistic analysis through the use of the ergodic secrecy
capacity or secrecy outage probability (SOP) [3]. Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume that
the legitimate link between Alice and Bob experiences no misalignment issues, which generally
holds in scenarios when the receiving apertures are located fairly close to each other [6]. On the
other hand, the fraction of the power received by Eve must encompass the existence of pointing
errors, which generally depends on the distance between Bob and Eve [6]–[8].
In [2], the secrecy capacity is used for FSO systems as a performance metric. However, such
approach does not take into account both reliability and secrecy and cannot be utilized to set a
target secrecy rate R. The effective secrecy throughput (EST) was proposed in [9] as a way to
encompass both reliability and secrecy in a single metric. In [9], the authors adopt the EST to
evaluate the performance of a RF-based single-input single-output multiple-antenna eavesdropper
(SISOME) scenario considering the so-called adaptive and fixed-rate schemes. While for the
adaptive scheme the legitimate channel instantaneous capacity is available at Alice (reliability
constraint is guaranteed), for the fixed-rate scheme Alice possesses only the expected value of
such capacity. The authors in [9] then provide some insights on the optimal secrecy rate that
maximizes the EST. However, the maximum EST obtained in [9] does not present any constraint
in terms of SOP, which means that the optimization may lead to an outage probability that might
be above an acceptable security threshold. Aiming at avoiding this possible security issue, the
EST was then extended in [10] with the addition of a constraint on the maximum allowed SOP.
Such constrained EST was then adopted to evaluate the performance of a RF-based multiple-
input multiple-output multiple-antenna eavesdropper system, subjected to Rayleigh fading and
operating under the adaptive scheme from [9].
A. FSO
Depending on the detection type, FSO communication systems can be separated in two main
categories, namely coherent and direct detection (DD) systems [11]. While the maximum capacity
bounds of DD systems have been studied in a number of works such as [12], [13], in [14], it is
shown that coherent detection outperforms direct detection at the cost of a higher complexity.
Furthermore, the extraction of phase information for coherent FSO systems allows a greater
variety of modulation formats in comparison with direct detection [15].
4
The transmission in FSO communication is affected by a large number of phenomena, among
which the most harmful is the scintillation, defined as the random fading characteristic of
the received optical intensity [2]. As a consequence, the received optical irradiance in FSO
communication, regardless the detection type, is commonly modeled by means of more complex
(and difficult to manipulate) statistical distributions such as gamma-gamma [16]–[18]. Apart
from scintillation effect, pointing errors must also be taken into account when there is a non-
negligible misalignment between the transmitter and receiver nodes [7]. While in the legitimate
link perfect alignment is commonly assumed [6], such assumption is not realistic to the link
between Alice and Eve, since Eve cannot be too close to Bob in order not to be detected.
In [19], the authors compare the performance in terms of reliability, not secrecy, of a multiple-
input multiple-output (MIMO) scenario when transmit laser selection (TLS), repetition coding
(RC) or relay-based communication is adopted. The results indicate that the best performance
among such techniques is achieved when adding more apertures, which is exploited using TLS,
between the transmitter and the receiver.
Finally, it is worthy mentioning that the secrecy can be improved by using techniques such
as orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing, scintillation reciprocity and acousto-optic
deflectors. The use of orbital angular momentum multiplexing (OAM) is studied in [20] to
increase the aggregate secrecy capacity1, and it is demonstrated that the performance can be
improved for weak and medium turbulence regimes. In [21], the use of acousto-optic deflectors
are proposed to further increase the data security. In such approach, optical messages are sent
through different beam paths between Alice and Bob, while it is shown that the radius of the
beam, and the intensity of the received beam from different beam paths, directly affects the data
transmission security. Moreover, an air-to-ground FSO communication system is investigated
in [22], demonstrating that, for any FSO system where the scintillation reciprocity holds, the
communication can be further improved through the use of a cryptosystem relying on the securely
generated keys. While each of the aforementioned methods can be used to further improve the
FSO communication in its own way, none of them are based on wiretap codes (i.e., do not use
the redundancy rate) and, thus, does not give any insight about the optimum value of RE .
1The aggregate secrecy capacity is defined as the summation of the secrecy capacity for all multiplexed channels [20].

B. Contribution
In this work, we consider a multiple-input multiple-output multi-apertures eavesdropper (MI-
MOME) coherent FSO scenario, where Alice adopts TLS while Bob and Eve operate under the
optimal maximum ratio combining (MRC) scheme [23]. By adopting the constrained EST metric
from [10] and considering gamma-gamma distribution to model the fading of the FSO channel,
we evaluate the performance of the adaptive and fixed-rate transmission schemes from [9]. The
main contributions of this paper are described as follows:
1) We obtain closed form EST expressions for both adaptive and fixed-rate schemes in a
coherent FSO scenario where the eavesdropper is subject to pointing errors, which are
verified by numerical results;
2) The rates RE and RB that maximize the EST for both adaptive and fixed-rate schemes
are analytically obtained, respecting the constraint of a maximum allowed SOP;
3) We demonstrate that, when operating under the fixed-rate scheme, including additional
apertures can lead to a larger EST than that obtained using the adaptive scheme;
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section II presents the system model, the
adaptive and fixed-rate transmission schemes, and the EST performance metric. Considering a
MIMOME FSO communication, Sections III and IV present the performance analysis of the
adaptive and the fixed-rate transmission schemes, respectively. Section V presents numerical
results, while Section VI concludes the paper.
II. PRELIMINARIES
A. System Model
The model adopted in this work is composed of one legitimate transmitter, Alice (A), commu-
nicating with a legitimate receiver, Bob (B), in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve (E). Alice
is equipped with NA transmit apertures working under transmit laser selection (TLS) scheme,
while Bob and Eve are provided with, respectively, NB and NE receive apertures, using the
optimum MRC scheme. This scenario, referred to as MIMOME, is illustrated in Fig. 1.
Following [11], [24], [25], we employ coherent detection, which, despite being more complex
than direct detection, provides flexibility since either amplitude, frequency or phase can be used.
In such systems, even though the capacity initially increases with the increase in the diameter
of the receiver aperture, it tends to saturate, justifying the use of multiple apertures at the

apertures) and a legitimate receiver (Bob, provided with NB receive apertures), communicating in the presence of an eavesdropper

receiver [26]. We also consider that the irradiance received at apertures in Bob and Eve are
independent, i.e., the large-scale and small-scale effects experienced by Bob are independent
from that seen at Eve, which holds in a scenario where the distance between Bob and Eve are
greater than the correlation length d0 ?
?
?dk [27], where ? is the wave length and dk is the
distance between the transmit and receive k ? {B,E} nodes [19]. In FSO communications
through the turbulent atmosphere, the maximum achievable rate per unit of bandwidth is given
by log2(1 + ?k) bits/s/Hz, where ?k is the signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver, which is
random due to the nature of the channel [28]. If the noise is dominated by local oscillator shot
noise, the SNR at Bob or Eve, after a transmission from Alice, can be expressed as [15], [29],
[30]
?k =

where ?e is the quantum efficiency of the photodetector, Es is the symbol energy, A is the
photodetector area, h denotes the Planck’s constant, v denotes the frequency of the received
optical signal, ?f is the is the noise equivalent bandwidth, A0 = erf

transmitter and the receiver, erf(·) is the error function, ? =

?2?/?b, ? is the radius of the
receive aperture and ?b is the received beam size.
Finally, Ik represents the irradiance associated with the link between Alice and receiver k.
For a given i-th transmit aperture of Alice and j-th receive aperture of node k, Ik can be
expressed as Ii,jk = I
i,j
l,k I

i,j
p,k, where I
i,j
a,k is the fading caused by atmospheric turbulence, I
i,j
p,k
is the pointing error and I i,jl,k represents the attenuation due to path-loss. Similarly to RF wireless
7
channels [31], since large-scale fluctuations in the irradiance are generated due to turbulent
eddies, we follow [32] and assume that, for a given receiver node k, the large-scale effects are
fully correlated among the receiving apertures, which holds when the received signal in each
photodetector propagates through the same large-scale eddies. Thus, without loss of generality,
in the rest of this paper we assume that I i,jl,k = 1 [33].
The pointing errors in the legitimate link are assumed to be negligible, such that I i,jp,B = 1.
This can be achieved in practice, for example, by means of perfect alignment [6]. However,
the same does not hold to Eve, which is subjected to pointing errors. We also consider that the
receiving apertures of Eve are close enough such that all of them are affected in the occurrence
of a pointing error.
Thus, for the MIMOME model adopted in this work, Ik can be written as [15], [29], [34],

Note that, although the eavesdropper is capable of accessing the feedback channel from Bob
to Alice, the selected aperture is optimum to the legitimate channel only so that the aperture
index alone cannot be exploited by the eavesdropper [36]. This behavior is represented by the
maxi=1,...,NA term in (2). Following [18], [19], [37], [38], we also adopt the gamma-gamma fading
model to represent the turbulence induced by scintillation, in which the pdf of the turbulence in
a single link (I i,ja,k, which we refer to as I in order to ease the notation) for (I ? 0) is given by

with ?e = (
?
??2b erf(?)/(2? exp (??2)))1/2 as the equivalent beamwaist and ? as the radial
displacement at the receiver. Considering that Eve’s displacement follows an independent and
identical Gaussian distribution with standard deviation ?s for both vertical and horizontal axis,
the pdf of the pointing errors can be then expressed as [6]

Since the laser beam emitted by Alice suffers divergence due to optical diffraction, following
the approach described in [2], we assume that Eve is located in the divergence region, implying
that Eve is close to Bob [40] and is able to obtain part of the laser beam not captured by Bob,
as shown in Fig. 1. In such approach, communication is inherently secure for small divergence
angles but, for long distances, Eve has a better chance to eavesdrop.
From [33], we have that when both pointing error and atmospheric turbulence are considered,
i.e., Ii,jE = I i,ja,E I i,jp,E, the irradiance distribution is given by

where Gp,qm,n (·) is the Meijer-G function. Finally, it is worthy mentioning that we assume the
phase distortion to be negligible, which can be achieved in practice through the use of modal
compensation techniques such as, e.g., Zernike polynomials [41].
2The wave number is defined as the spatial frequency of a wave and, in this work, we use it as the number of radians per
unit distance.

B. Transmission Schemes
The MIMOME FSO scenario adopted in this work employs two transmission techniques
from [9], namely adaptive and fixed-rate transmission schemes. Then, in order to asses the
performance of such schemes, the average CSI of the eavesdropper channel must be assumed at
Alice, which is the strategy commonly adopted by the literature (c.f., [2], [9], [42]). Noting that
Eve is usually close to Bob in these scenarios, large-scale and small-scale parameters experienced
by Bob and Eve can be assumed similar [2]. Therefore, although the average CSI with respect
to Eve is very unlikely to be known in practice, the system can still be designed to be secure
for a worst-case scenario.
1) Adaptive Transmission Scheme: In the case when Alice possesses instantaneous CSI with
respect to Bob, and average SNR about Eve, Alice is able to calculate the instantaneous channel
capacity CB and consequently adjust RE and R according to CB , subject to the constraint
0 ? RB ? CB. This guarantees the reliability constraint. In turn, the violation of the secrecy
constraint is defined as the probability that the equivocation rate RE is less than the capacity of
the eavesdropper channel (CE).
2) Fixed-Rate Transmission Scheme: Differently from the adaptive scheme, for the fixed-
rate transmission scheme both instantaneous CB and CE are unavailable at Alice, meaning that
Alice has only the average SNR of the main and eavesdropper’s channels. This scheme is more
practical (and less complex) than the Adaptive scheme since it requires no feedback from Bob
to Alice. Note also that, in this scheme, both the reliability and the secrecy constraints are not
guaranteed, and one must determine RB and RE that jointly maximize the EST.
Note that the performance of both schemes rely on the assumption that Alice possess the
average CSI with respect to Eve, not having any information about its instantaneous CSI. This
is an assumption commonly adopted in the literature and supported by the fact that a worst-case
scenario can be established based on large-scale and small-scale parameters experienced by Bob
(assumed to be similar to Eve), while the turbulence and pointing error-free average value can
be obtained directly from (6).

C. Effective Secrecy Throughput with Eavesdropper Outage Constraints
The EST is a metric proposed in [42] that uses both reliability and secrecy constraints to
determine the throughput of the wiretap channel, being defined as [9]
?(RE ,RB) = (RB ?RE)
reliability
? ?? ?
[1?O(RB)]
secrecy
? ?? ?
[1? S(RE)], (8)
where O(RB) = Pr{RB > CB} corresponds to the outage probability (in terms of reliability)
and S(RE) = Pr{RE ? CE} represents the SOP.
Even though the EST presented in [42] is a useful performance metric, it does not impose
any constraint regarding the SOP, which means that Eve might operate at a very low outage
probability, acquiring a confidential information and, thus, compromising secrecy. In [10], the
authors circumvent this problem by imposing a constraint and defining the EST as
?m(RE ,RB) =
?
?
?
?(RE ,RB), if S(RE) ? S th;
0, if S(RE) > S th,
(9)
where ?(RE ,RB) and S(RE) represent respectively the constrained EST and the SOP, and S th
is the maximum allowed value of S(RE). For simplicity, in the rest of this work we drop the
index m in the EST from (9) and consider the EST with no constraints as the particular case
where S th = 1.
III. EST OF ADAPTIVE MIMOME FSO COMMUNICATION
Since Alice possesses the instantaneous CSI regarding the legitimate channel, the reliability
constraint is always guaranteed (i.e., Oa(RB) = 0) in the adaptive scheme. The EST from (8)
can then be adjusted to the adaptive scheme as:
?a(RE) = (CB ?RE) [1? S(RE)] . (10)
In order to obtain a closed-form expression to the EST of the adaptive scheme, one needs to
evaluate the SOP:
S(RE) = Pr{CE > RE} = Pr
{
?E > 2
RE ? 1
}
= Pr
{IEA0
N0
> 2RE ? 1
}
.
(11)
Note that solving (11) is not a straightforward task since the irradiance is composed of the tur-
bulence (which is modeled as the summation of random variables due to the diversity combining
technique), and another random variable that represents the pointing errors.
11
Lemma 1. The SOP of the adaptive scheme3 is given by
S(RE) = 1? F ??pE (XE), (12)
where XE =
N0(2RE?1)
NEA0
, and F ??pE (·) represents the cdf when both pointing errors and atmo-
spheric turbulence are considered, which is given by

where ?k = ?(dk) and ?k = ?(dk)Nk represent, respectively, the large-scale and the small-
scale parameters related to the number of cells in the scattering process [18], 1F?2(·) denotes
the regularized hypergeometric function, and a = [bi, bi ? ?2] ,b = [?E , ?E] , c = [?1, 1],d =
[bi + 1, (?E ? ?E) ci + 1] , e = [(?E ? ?E) ci + 1, bi ? ?2 + 1] are auxiliary vectors.
Proof: Please refer to Appendix A.
The EST is then obtained by placing (12) in (10).
A. Optimal Target Secrecy Rate
When evaluating the EST from (10), one can see that while a larger RE leads to a smaller
value of (CB ?RE), it simultaneously increases 1?Pr{CE > RE}. Thus, one could expect to
exist an optimal value of RE that maximizes the EST. When considering an outage constrained
scenario, however, one needs to check whether such optimal value meets the outage constraint
or not. In this sense, we have the following result.
Theorem 1. The value of RE that maximizes the outage-constrained EST for the MIMOME
FSO adaptive scheme is
Ra?E = max
(
Ra?E,u,Rth

both schemes.

IV. EST OF FIXED-RATE MIMOME FSO COMMUNICATION
In the fixed-rate scheme, both reliability and secrecy cannot be guaranteed, and the EST is
obtained as
?f(RE ,RB) = (RB ?RE)
[
1?Of(RB)
]
[1? S(RE)] . (18)
4Note that, to obtain (15), the gamma-gamma variable in (11) is approximated as a gamma variable as described in Appendix B.
13
The SOP in (18) is obtained from (12). The reliability probability, in turn, is
1?Of(RB) = Pr{CB > RB}
= Pr{?B > 2RB ? 1}
= Pr
{IBA0
N0
> 2RB ? 1
}
.
(19)
Having in mind that the turbulence IB in (19) encompasses the effects of both TLS and MRC,
one has that (19) is given as follows.
Lemma 2. The outage probability, which is used to obtain the probability of transmission, is
given by
Of(RB) = F ??B (XB)NA, (20)
where XB =
N0(2RB?1)
NBA0
and F ??B (·), represents the cdf of a single gamma-gamma random
variable for the SNR for Bob, and is given by [18]
F ??B (XB) =

]
,
(21)
where 1F2(·) denotes the generalized hypergeometric function.
Proof: In order to obtain (20), the same approach used in Lemma 1 has been adopted, with
the difference that (20) does not take into account the pointing errors and it presents the effect
of TLS, noting that it is related to the legitimate channel.
The EST of the fixed-rate scheme is finally obtained after replacing (12) and (20) in (18).
A. Optimal Target Secrecy Rate
Differently from the adaptive scheme, in the fixed-rate scheme the EST is a function of both

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we present some numerical results in order to evaluate the previous analysis,
adopting the same turbulence-free SNR ?0 for both Eve and Bob, with dk = dB = dE = 1 km,
? = 1550 nm [19], and using the adjustment ? = 0 and ? = 0.97 for the approximated gamma
variable5, unless stated otherwise. Following [8], we also use ?b = 2.5 and ? = 0.1.
Fig. 2 presents the EST with secrecy constraints versus the redundancy rate for the adaptive
transmission scheme with ?s ? {1, 2, 3} and NA = NE = 2, for different values of S th. One
can see that, as the standard deviation of pointing error displacement increases, the maximum
allowed SOP is also increased, meaning that, depending on ?s, the system might have to operate
with a lower value of ?a(RE) in order to ensure that the maximum allowed SOP is feasible. Note
that this is in accordance with the proposed system model, since the increase of ?s decreases
the fraction of the power received by Eve, provided that it increases the probability of the
eavesdropper being outside the received beam radius ?b. From Fig. 2, we can also see that the
approximated theoretic values (represented by the red circles) of Ra?E,u (unconstrained) and Rth
?
E
(for S th ? {0.6, 0.4, 0.2}) from, respectively, (15) and (16), and represented by red dots are in
good agreement with the optimal numerical results for different values of ?s, demonstrating an
approximation error below 2%. Note also that, as stated in Appendix B and similar to that seen
in [9], [10], [42], the stationary points obtained from (15) represent the local maximum for all
the scenarios evaluated in this work.
In order to validate the analytical derivations of Lemmas 1 and 2, Fig. 3 presents the EST
versus the redundancy rate RE and the rate of transmitted codewords RB for NA = NE = 2,
NB = 1 and ?s = 2 in an unconstrained scenario (S th = 1.0). We can see that the results
using (12) and (20) match exactly the simulation results, confirming the usefulness of such
equations. Moreover, note that the SOP derivation in (12) is applied for both adaptive and fixed-
rate schemes6, such that Fig. 3 also validates the obtained SOP expression for the adaptive
scheme.
Fig. 4(a) presents the unconstrained value (S th = 1.0) of the EST versus the redundancy
rate RE and the rate of transmitted codewords RB , for the fixed-rate transmission scheme with
5Using the approximation proposed in [43], ? and ? must be chosen in order to minimize the difference between the results
obtained by the cdf of gamma-gamma and gamma random variables.
6While the EST obtained for the fixed-rate scheme requires both the SOP and the reliability probability, for the adaptive
scheme only the SOP is required.

NA = NE = 2, NB = 1 and ?s = 2. One can see that there is an optimal value of RB for each
value of RE (and vice versa), and that there is a stationary point of ?f(RE ,RB) that results
in the optimal EST, as stated in Appendix D. We can also see that the approximated theoretic
values of Rf?E,u = 1.250 bpcu and Rf
?
B,u = 3.401 bpcu from, respectively, (22a) and (22b), are
in good agreement with the optimal numerical rates RE = 1.257 bpcu and RB = 3.400 bpcu,
which results in ?f(RE ,RB) = 0.621 bpcu.
In Fig. 4(b) we present a similar analysis, but imposing a secrecy constraint S th = 0.5. The
threshold value Rth?E , for which any value lower than that will result in an SOP greater than
the threshold Sth, can be obtained directly from (16). Note that, in agreement to Theorem 2,

using (9), (10) and (18) are in perfect agreement with simulations. We can also see that, as the
maximum allowed SOP increases, the maximum EST obtained by both schemes also increases,
and that a higher number of apertures in the legitimate channel allows the system to achieve a
lower SOP even in the unconstrained scenario. Furthermore, it is shown that the adaptive scheme

is able to obtain a higher EST than that obtained using the fixed-rate scheme, which is expected
since, when using the adaptive scheme, Alice has the instantaneous CSI about the legitimate
channel.
Fig. 6 presents the EST versus NA = NB = NE for the adaptive and fixed-rate schemes for
S th ? {1, 0.3, 0.1}. We can see that, as the number of apertures increases for all nodes, the
maximum obtained EST also increases. This can be explained by the fact that the diversity order
in the legitimate channel increases faster than that seen in the eavesdropper channel. Curiously,
the EST is approximately the same for the adaptive scheme with NA = NB = NE = 5 and
S th = 0.3, and for the fixed-rate scheme with NA = NB = NE = 10 and S th = 1.0. This implies
that, in a scenario with five apertures per node, the adaptive scheme allows to restrict the SOP
to be as low as 30%, while still achieving the same EST performance as the unconstrained
fixed-rate scheme with ten apertures per node.

Finally, in Fig. 7 we present the EST versus ?s for the adaptive and fixed-rate schemes, with
S th = 0.2. One can see that, as the standard deviation of pointing error displacement increases,
the EST for both schemes increases. As seen in Fig. 2, this is due to the fact that the increase
in ?s decreases the capacity of the eavesdropper channel.
VI. FINAL COMMENTS
In this work, we characterized the MIMOME performance for coherent FSO transmissions.
A threat scenario where Eve is near Bob was investigated, meaning that the difference of SNR
seen at Bob and Eve is affected not only by NA, NB and NE, but also by the pointing errors
due to misalignment between Alice and Eve. By adopting the EST with secrecy constraints
as the performance metric, the optimal rates for the adaptive and fixed-rate schemes were
obtained. Numerical results confirmed the accuracy of the mathematical derivations. Moreover,
our analytical and simulation results demonstrated that, independent of the maximum allowed
SOP, the EST for the adaptive scheme outperforms that obtained using the fixed-rate transmission
scheme for coherent FSO communications. Finally, we also show that a significant gain is
achieved when adding multiple apertures, and that the overall EST is also dependent on the
distance between Eve and Bob. Future works include the analysis of the EST with secrecy
constraints using non-coherent reception, in which the channel capacity changes significantly,
and the use of relays.

APPENDIX A
PROOF OF LEMMA 1
In order to obtain (12), we first resort to the fact that the probability from (11) can be rewritten
as
S(RE) = Pr

where X, Y ? ? (·) are, respectively, the large-scale and small-scale parameters of the gamma-
gamma random variable, both of which are gamma distributed with shape parameter k inversely
proportional to the scale parameter ?, i.e, ? = 1
k
, and Z represents the random variable due to
pointing error which the pdf is given by (5). Due to the spatial proximity of the apertures and
the inherent LOS nature of FSO systems, the large-scale can be assumed equal to all receive
apertures [32], such that (25) can be rewritten as
S(RE) = Pr

. (26)
Using the summation property, where the summation of a gamma variable with shape k and

all shape parameters [44], i.e.,
?NE
n=1Xn ? ?
(

. In order to obtain ? = 1
k
as proposed in [18] and
used in (3), we resort to the scale property, where the product of a gamma variable by a constant
can be rewritten as a gamma variable where the scale parameter ? is the product of the original
scale by the constant, i.e., cX ? ?(k, c?) and, thus
S(RE) = Pr

, (28)
where Y?E ? ?

which results in (13) and can be used directly to obtain (12), concluding the proof.

By setting ??a(RE)/?RE = 0 and solving to RE , we obtain the stationary point of ?a(RE),
which is given by (15). We have that, similarly to [9], an analysis of identifying stationary
points via (15) and ?2?a(RE)/?R2E is not tractable. Noting that the probability from (30) is a
monotonically decreasing function of RE (for RE < CB) and following a similar approach as
presented in [9], we instead investigate through simulations and numerical calculations the nature
of the stationary points, finding that (10) is concave or semi-concave with only one stationary
point for all tested simulations. This is in agreement with the monotonically decreasing behavior
of (30). Thus, we find that the stationary points given by (15) always identify the local maximum
in the simulations, as presented in Section V.
Resorting to the fact that S(RE) is a monotonically decreasing function of RE7, one can
see that the redundancy rate at a given threshold S th is the minimum redundancy rate allowed.
Using (30), one can find the inverse function with respect to S th, which is given by (16). Noting
that ?a(RE) increases for RE < Ra
?
E,u and decreases for RE > Ra
?
E,u, we have that, without
constraints, Ra?E,u represents the maximum redundancy rate, in the sense that any value different
than Ra?E,u will result in a lower value of ?a(RE). Noting that Ra
?
E cannot be smaller than (16)
(due to the SOP constraint), one can conclude that Ra?E,u is the maximum value between (15)
and (16), which is given by (14).
7 This can be easily proved by showing that ?S(R)/?R > 0, ?R < CB .

?f(RE ,RB). (32)
Replacing (12) and (20) in (18), and using the approximation of a gamma-gamma variable by

and R = RB ?RE . Solving (34) for RE , we obtain (22a). Using
a similar approach, by setting the first-order partial derivative of (33) with respect of RE to
zero and solving to RB , we obtain (22b). Based on Young’s theorem [45], similarly to that used
in [9], the Hessian matrix of (33) is symmetric, and can be expressed as

For A < 0 and A · C ? B2 > 0, then (Rf?E,u,R

of ?f(RE ,RB).
APPENDIX D
PROOF OF THEOREM 2
First, one must note that S(RE) is a monotonically decreasing function of RE , which means
that, if Rf?E,u < Rth
?
E , then using Rf
?
E,u will result in a SOP greater than the maximum allowed
S th. Following a similar approach as described in Appendix B, one can conclude that the optimal
value of RE in a constrained scenario is given by the maximum between Rf
?
E,u and Rth
?
E , which
results in (23a).
23
Noting that Rf?B,u does not represent the optimal value of RB when R
f?
E,u < Rth
?
E , one must
find the optimal value of RB for a fixed value of RE = Rth
?
E . Similar to that presented in [9]
and described in Appendix B, we have that the value of RB that achieves the stationary point
of ?f(RE ,RB) is the optimal RB for a fixed value of RE , which is obtained by replacing (12)
and (20) in (18), equating the first derivative to zero and solving for RB . It follows that the first
derivative is given by
