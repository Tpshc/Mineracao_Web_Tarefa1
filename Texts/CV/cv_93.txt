ABSTRACT
Automatic recognition of historical handwritten manuscripts is a
daunting task due to paper degradation over time. The performance
of information retrieval algorithms depends heavily on feature de-
tection and representation methods. Although there exist popular
feature descriptors such as Scale Invariant Feature Transform and
Speeded Up Robust Features, in order to represent handwritten
words in a document, a robust descriptor is required that is not over-
precise. This is because handwritten words across different docu-
ments are indeed similar, but not identical. Therefore, this paper
introduces a Radial Line Fourier (RLF) descriptor for handwritten
word feature representation, which is fast to construct and short-
length with 32 elements only. The effectiveness of the proposed
RLF descriptor is empirically evaluated using the VLFeat bench-
marking framework (VLBenchmarks), and for handwritten word
image representation using a historical marriage records dataset.

1 INTRODUCTION
Automatic recognition of poorly degraded handwritten text is a
daunting task due to complex layouts and paper degradations over
time. Typically, an old manuscript suffers from degradations such as
paper stains, faded ink and ink bleed-through. There is a variability
in writing style, and the presence of text and symbols written in
an unknown language. This hampers the document readability
and make tasks like word spotting more challenging. However, the
performance of information retrieval algorithms as well as other
computer vision applications depends heavily on the appropriate
selection of feature detection and representation methods [11].
Efforts have beenmade in the recent past towards research on fea-
ture detection and representation. Some popular methods include

Features (SURF) [4] and Histograms of oriented Gradients (HoG)
[8]. SIFT and HoG contributed significantly towards the progress of
several visual recognition systems in the last decade [12]. In a word
spotting scenario, the performance of different features was evalu-
ated using Dynamic TimeWarping (DTW) [23] and Hidden Markov
Models (HMMs) [24]. It was found that local gradient histogram
features outperform other geometrical or profile-based features.
These methods generally match features from evenly distributed
locations over normalised words [22] where no nearest neighbour
search is necessary as each point in a word has its corresponding
point in the other word located in the very same position. Recently,
a method based on feature matching of keypoints derived from the
words was proposed [14], which requires a nearest neigbour search.
In this case, a robust descriptor is required that is not too precise,
since the handwritten words are not normalised. This is due to
complex characteristic of handwritten words, unlike simple OCR
text. Handwritten words across different documents are indeed
similar, but not identical due to variability in writing styles.
This paper proposes a Radial Line Fourier (RLF) descriptor for
handwritten word feature representation. In general, the RLF de-
scriptor is based on the idea of radial lines integration. RLF descrip-
tor is tailor-made for word spotting applications with fast feature
representation and robustness to degradations. However, the RLF
descriptor can be flexibly used in other applications for feature
representation of challenging images with promising results. The
VLFeat benchmarking framework called VLBenchmarks [17] is used
to test the descriptor performance. The RLF descriptor is capable of
handling viewpoint changes, scale-invariance to a limited extent,
and conditions such as illumination, defocus and image compres-
sion. This paper evaluates the RLF descriptor on degraded word
images and challenging scene images of varying image conditions.
Also an elaborate comparison analysis is done using RLF and other
popular methods such as SIFT and SURF using VLBenchmarks to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RLF descriptor.
2 RELATEDWORK
Appropriate selection of interest points and descriptors is indispens-
able for the performance of a word spotting system. This section
discusses some popular interest point detection and feature repre-
sentation methods with reference to word spotting systems.
2.1 Interest Point Detection
Feature detection, or interest point detection refers to finding key
points in an image that contain crucial information. The selection
of interest point detectors has a great impact on the performance
of an information retrieval algorithm. Several methods have been
suggested in literature for interest point detection [27, 32, 34]. The

Harris corner detector [13] is popularly used for corner points
detection. It computes a combination of eigenvalues of the structure
tensor such that the corners are located in an image. Shi-Tomasi
corner detector [28] is a modified version of Harris detector. The
minimum of two eigenvalues is computed and a point is considered
as a corner point if this minimum value exceeds a certain threshold.
The FAST detector [26], based on the SUSAN detector [29], uses a
circular mask to test against the central pixel. MSER [19] detects
keypoints such that all pixels inside the extremal region are either
darker or brighter than all the outer boundary pixels.
In general, interest point based feature matching is done by
using a single type of interest point detector. SIFT and SURF are
the most popular ones that capture the blob type of features in the
image. SIFT uses the Difference of Gaussians (DoG) that computes
the difference between Gaussian blurred images using different
values of ? , where ? defines the Gaussian blur from a continuous
point of view. SURF computes the Determinant of the Hessian
(DoH) matrix, that defines the product of the eigenvalues. Several
different combinations of any number of interest point detectors
can be chosen depending upon the application [32]. On the other
hand, the RLF descriptor proposed in this work is independent of
the choice of interest points selection. Any efficient interest point
detection method can be flexibly employed with the RLF descriptor.
2.2 Feature Representation
After a set of interest points has been detected, a suitable represen-
tation of their values has to be defined to allow matching between
a query word image and the document image. In general, a feature
descriptor is constructed from the pixels in the local neighborhood
of each interest point. Fixed length feature descriptors are most
commonly used that generate a fixed length feature vector, which
can be easily compared using standard distance metrics (e.g. the
Euclidean distance). Sometimes, fixed length feature vectors are
computed directly from the extracted features without the need of
a learning step [11].
Gradient-based feature descriptors tend to be superior, and in-
clude SIFT [18], HoG [8] and SURF [4] descriptors. The 128 dimen-
sional SIFT descriptor is formed from histograms of local gradients.
SIFT is both scale and rotation invariant, and includes a complex
underlying framework to ensure this. Similarly, HoG computes a
histogram of gradient orientations in a certain local region. How-
ever, SIFT and HoG differ in the sense that HoG normalizes the
histograms in overlapping blocks, and creates a redundant expres-
sion. The SURF descriptor is generally faster than SIFT, and is
created by concatenating Haar wavelet responses in sub-regions of
an oriented square window. SIFT and SURF are invariant to rotation
changes, unlike HoG. There are several variants of these descriptors
that have been effectively employed for word spotting [11, 23, 30].
The KAZE detector [2] uses a non linear scale space created
using non linear diffusion filtering, instead of Gaussian Blurring. An
accelerated version AKAZE [21] uses a faster method for creating
the scale space and a binary descriptor. Many feature descriptors use
the local image content in square areas around each interest point
to form a feature vector [14]. Both scale and rotation invariance
can be obtained in different ways [10]. The Fourier transform has
been used to compute descriptors [6, 7, 33] that is illumination
and rotation invariant, and scale-invariant to a certain extent. In
order to overcome dimensionality issues, binary descriptors are
introduced that are faster, but less precise, for example the BRISK
descriptor [17] and FREAK [1, 17].
The choice of feature descriptor depends upon the target appli-
cation. For handwritten words representation in a document, a fast
and robust descriptor like RLF descriptor is required that is not
over-precise. The RLF descriptor is discussed in detail as follows.
3 RADIAL LINE FOURIER DESCRIPTOR
Radial Line Fourier (RLF) Descriptor is inspired from a variant of
Scale Invariant Descriptor (SID) [16], i.e. SID-Rot [31]. In general,
the idea is to perform log-polar sampling in a circular neighborhood
around each keypoint [15]. Then the Fourier transform is applied
over scales, making it rotation sensitive (hence the name SID-Rot).
However, a desirable property is that it will be less sensitive to scale
changes. Nevertheless, in order to achieve this, the descriptor is
dense with a very large radius, and a length of 3360.
The RLF descriptor addresses this issue and computes a fast and
short-length feature vector of 32 dimensions, to be able to perform
quick matching in the nearest neighbour search. The RLF descriptor
is formed directly from the interest points extracted, without the
need to involve a learning step. It characterizes an image region as
a whole using a single feature vector of fixed size.
To begin with, the Fourier Feature Transform (FFT) is simplified
as it is rather slow and requires O (N lo?(N )) computations for a
discrete series f (n) with N elements. The modification is such that
each element needed will be computed using the Discrete Fourier
Transform (DFT) f (n) . Therefore, rewriting using Eulers formula,
the computation required is
F[f (n)](k ) =
N?1?
n=0
f (n) cos(2?nk/N ) ? i(f (n) sin(2?nk/N )). (1)
The value of k determines the frequency used to compute the
Fourier element, where k ? 0, 2, 4... Since noise has higher fre-
quencies as compared to the main structures in the image with
lower frequencies, the second (k = 2) and third (k = 4) elements
of the Fourier transform are selected to form a descriptor. Hence,
now the algorithm requires onlyO (N ) computations. Note that the
Discrete Cosine (DC) component is obtained for k = 0 and is less
informative. The trigonometric functions in the DFT do not have to
be computed for each step as they can be efficiently computed using
a few additions and multiplications by the Chebyshev recurrence
relation [3, 5], just as is done in the case of FFT.
The RLF descriptor is constructed by computing the amplitude:
|F [f (n)](k)| =
?
?(F [f (n)](k))2 + ?(F [f (n)](k))2. (2)
Forming the descriptor using only k = 2 suffices very well and the
descriptor is very short. However, adding a second element fork = 4
improves the quality of the subsequent matching noticeably, even if
the feature vector will be twice as long. The advantage is, however,
that it makes it possible to sample in a smaller neighborhood, while
still getting the same number of corresponding matches, as it is
more accurate. Nevertheless, adding a third element for k = 6 did
not improve the accuracy significantly, and is found to be not worth
the extra computational effort.

Word Representation , ,
When sampling is done in a log-polar fashion, some kind of
interpolation is required as coordinates seldom are in pixel centres.
One could for instance use bilinear interpolation to achieve higher
accuracy. However, interpolation in a 3x3 neighborhood using a
Gaussian is chosen instead.
The RLF descriptor is illumination and rotation invariant, and
also scale-invariant to a limited extent. These are important char-
acteristics a feature vector must possess to handle different kind of
words with varying size, shape, slant characters etc. RLF descriptor
is resistant to high frequency changes, such as due to residuals from
neighboring words, as it is based on the low frequency content in
the local neighborhood. Nevertheless, it is insensitive to small dif-
ferences in form and shape as long as they are more or less the same,
i.e. the low frequencies are sufficiently similar. The RLF descriptor
present a clear advantage over other feature representations as has
been experimentally validated in the next section.
4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
This section describes the datasets used in the experiments and
empirically evaluates the proposed RLF descriptor.
4.1 Esposalles Dataset
In order to evaluate the performance of RLF descriptor in repre-
senting a word in a degraded historical document, a subset of the
Barcelona Historical Handwritten Marriages (BH2M) database [9]
i.e. Esposalles dataset [25] is used for the experiments. The Espos-
alles dataset consists of handwritten marriages records stored in
the archives of Barcelona cathedral, written between 1617 and 1619
by a single writer in old Catalan. In total, there are 174 handwritten
pages corresponding to the volume 69. For the experiments, 50
pages written by a single author are selected from the 17th century.
4.2 VGG Affine Dataset
VGG Affine dataset consists of a set of test images under varying
imaging conditions [20]. It consists of eight scene types i.e. graffiti,
wall, boat, bark, bikes, trees, ubc and leuven, where each of the
categories contain images with different conditions. It is employed
in the VLBenchmarks [17] framework for testing image feature
detectors and descriptors. This dataset effectively helps in testing
the performance of the RLF descriptor with reference to a variety
of test images, and for comparing with other feature descriptors
such as SIFT and SURF.
The descriptor is evaluated under five different imaging con-
ditions: viewpoint angle change, scale change, image blur, JPEG
compression and illumination change. The same change in imaging
conditions is applied in case of viewpoint change, scale change and
blur for two different scene categories. This means that the effect
of varying the image conditions can be separated from the effect
of varying the scene type. Structured scene category consists of
homogeneous regions with distinctive edge boundaries (e.g. graffiti
and buildings), and the textured scene category consists of repeated
textures of different forms [20].
In the test for viewpoint angle change, the camera varies from
frontal parallel view to significant foreshortening at approximately
60 degrees to the camera. The illumination variations are introduced
by changing the camera aperture. The scale change is acquired by
Table 1: Comparison between RLF and HoG descriptors for
finding three occurrences of the querywords. The average is
reported and thenumber of asterisks (?) denotes the count of
words not present due to a low number of matching points.

varying the camera zoom and it changes by about a factor of four.
The blur sequences are acquired by varying the camera focus. The
JPEG compression sequence is generated using a standard xv image
browser with the image quality parameter varying from 40% to
2%. Each of the test sequences contains six images with a gradual
geometric or photometric transformation. All images are of medium
resolution (approximately 800 x 640 pixels).
4.3 Results
To evaluate the performance of the RLF descriptor for word im-
age representation, the number of matched feature points and the
number of inliers are calculated. LetmatchedPointsNum indicate
the number of matched points, inliersNum indicate the number of
inliers i.e. true points, then the inlier ratio can be defined as:
InlierRatio =
matchedPointsNum
inliersNum
(3)
In the ideal case, the inlier ratio should be 1. In the first set of ex-
periments, the RLF descriptor is compared with the HoG descriptor
as it is most widely used in word spotting applications [23, 30]. For
the same query word, the number of matching interest points found
using RLF and HoG descriptors are calculated and quantitatively
evaluated as in Table 1. In order to perform word matching and
find all inliers, a preconditioner based simple clustering method is
employed. Figure 1 present the sample results obtained using RLF
and HoG feature descriptors for the two variants of example query
word reberé. The matching keypoints (i.e. inliers) are in green and
the matches that are discarded (i.e. outliers) by the preconditioner
are in red. It is clearly observed that the number of inliers found
using the RLF descriptor is more than the number of inliers found
using the HoG descriptor, and has been quantitatively evaluated in
Table 1. The matching algorithm divides the word into three parts
in order to avoid mismatching the same letter occurring in several
places. In the table one can note that HoG produces noticeably less
matching points. This causes the algorithm to miss some words.
In the experiments, three occurrences were found in the search
using RLF, while some were missed by HoG, and in one case none
was found. This could partly be solved by relaxing the threshold.
However, then some incorrect words are found instead. This clearly
shows the advantage of RLF over HoG, since it is less precise in
the sense that the neighborhood forming the descriptor can be non
equal, yet similar while being robust enough and not causing too
many mismatches, i.e. yielding a high inlier ratio.

In the next set of experiments, the performance of the RLF de-
scriptor is evaluated using the VLBenchmarks framework. Table
2 and Table 3 present the number of matches and match scores,
respectively, obtained using six different combinations of feature
detectors and descriptors, i.e. SIFT descriptor, 64-dimensional RLF
descriptor with SIFT keypoints (SIFT+RLF64 with 32 radial lines),
32-dimensional RLF descriptor with SIFT keypoints (SIFT+RLF32
with 16 radial lines), SURF descriptor, 64-dimensional RLF descrip-
tor with SURF keypoints (SURF+RLF64) and 32-dimensional RLF
descriptor with SURF keypoints (SURF+RLF32). The varying imag-
ing conditions taken into account include viewpoint angle change,
JPEG compression, decreasing light (illumination changes) and in-
creasing blur (defocus). The RLF descriptor is scale invariant to a
certain extent, and will be further investigated in future work.

Figures 2 and 3 graphically illustrate the matching performance
in terms of matching scores and the number of matches obtained
using different combinations of feature detectors and descriptors
with varying viewpoint angles. In Fig. 2, it can be seen that the
RLF performs fairly well with varying viewpoint angle changes,
in comparison with the SIFT descriptor. Figure 3 highlights the
performance of the RLF descriptor with viewpoint change in com-
parison with the SURF descriptor. It is clearly observed that the RLF
descriptor performs better than the SURF descriptor (length 64) in
terms of matching scores and the number of matches obtained.
Furthermore, tests are conducted using MSER and DoG keypoint
detectors with different feature descriptor combinations, i.e. SIFT,

ous descriptors and presents the set of results obtained using MSER

the categories and varying conditions. However, it performs fairly
in comparison with SIFT, not always better, depending upon the

This paper presented a fast and robust Radial Line Fourier descriptor.
The state-of-the-art feature descriptors such as SIFT, HoG and SURF
include a rather complicated framework which is not needed in all
applications such as word spotting. Therefore, a much simpler, yet
effective descriptor is proposed that is not too precise for handwrit-
ten words representation. The novelty of the proposed descriptor
lies in lesser computation time, shorter length of feature vector, in-
variance to rotation, viewpoint angles, and scale to a certain extent,
and other issues such as illumination, defocus and image compres-
sion. The experimental results on a historical marriage records
dataset and VGG Affine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed descriptor in handwritten word image representation
and test scene images from the VLBenchmarks framework. As fu-
ture work, the ideas presented herein will be scaled to aid word
feature representation for heavily degraded archival databases.
