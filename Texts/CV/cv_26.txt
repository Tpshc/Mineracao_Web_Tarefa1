Abstract—In this paper the intermediary visual content ver-
ification method based on multi-level co-occurrences is studied.
The co-occurrence statistics are in general used to determine
relational properties between objects based on information col-
lected from data. As such these measures are heavily subject to
relative number of occurrences and give only limited amount
of accuracy when predicting objects in real world. In order to
improve the accuracy of this method in the verification task,
we include the context information such as location, type of
environment etc. In order to train our model we provide new
annotated dataset the Advanced Attribute VOC (AAVOC) that
contains additional properties of the image. We show that the
usage of context greatly improve the accuracy of verification
with up to 16% improvement.
I. INTRODUCTION
Image or scene understanding is a domain of computer
vision aiming to provide a general and detailed description of
an image content. The scene understanding goes beyond object
detection, recognition, localization and segmentation, because
it aims at providing also the description on a semantic level as
well as explaining higher level relations between objects such
as behavior or activity [1], [2], [3].
The scene understanding can be oriented towards some par-
ticular type of scenes or images. For instance Matsuyama [4]
used logic reasoning with inference to improve the understand-
ing of satellite imaging. But with the increasing computing
power recently scene understanding has been focusing on
general scenes segmentation, semantic segmentation or scene
classification [5], [6], [7], [8].
With the advent of these more advanced methods and
because many of the algorithms are based on machine learning,
the quality of the processing heavily depends on the training
data and as such there is a strong bias-variance trade-off.
Consequently many algorithms resort to higher level content
related heuristics such as co-occurrence statistics [9], [10] to
provide a more reliable scene description.
Content verification [4], [11] is a problem related to the
analysis of content obtained from sensors and is aimed to
insure the quality of result of particular algorithm. It is most
commonly used in areas that deal with real-world informa-
tion such as computer vision, natural language processing or
robotic application. Additionally with the increasing complex-
ity of tasks intended to be performed by intelligent agents
as well as required reliability, it is necessary to ensure that
the perceived information and executed actions are performed
correctly.
In this paper we extend a previously proposed method for
content verification in [12], [13], [14] by enabling a context
aware verification approach. While initially the verification
method based on advanced co-occurrence statistics was de-
veloped for general set of images, we show that restricting
context and algorithm can effectively increase the accuracy of
verification process.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the
previous work, in Section III introduces the proposed method
of verification and Section IV describes the experiments.
Section V concludes this paper.
II. PREVIOUS WORK
Content verification is required when the result of process-
ing is not guaranteed to be accurate for all possible input
scenarios. This is often the case in machine learning when
the bias-variance is high due to training set data restriction.
In such case the result of image processing for instance, must
be verified for inconsistencies resulting from the imperfect
processing, lack of information or due to complexity of the
task. For instance, Figure 1 shows a set of examples of
semantic segmentation where a high level semantic verification
process can solve problems arising from the spurious results.

• Figure 1(a): parts of sofa (green) are mixed with parts of
chair (red) and such result can be semantically detected.
• Figure 1(b): variations of sizes between several objects of
the same class can be detected by relative size comparison
• Figure 1(c): the horse (pink) cannot be a dog (purple) at
the same time
• Figure 1(d): a horse (pink) cannot be a cat (dark red) at
a same time and a cat is also rarely under a horse.
Verification can be seen as a part of information restora-
tion process in signal processing or circuit computing [15].
On a higher semantic level Natural Language Processing
(NLP) often repairs the translated or generated content by
co-occurrence metrics [16], [17], [18], [19]. NLP uses co-
occurrence matrices to determine and to fill in correct words
in a sentence or to determine relations between words and a
context.
In computer vision reasoning is used to determine the cor-
rectness of the image content by analyzing higher-dimensional
relations between the obtained content. For instance [20] uses
co-occurrence statistics for object classification, in [21] similar
approach is used to reason about the geometrical disposition
to reason about missing elements using temporal and spatial
co-occurrences. In [12], [13] the reasoning is used to remove
or modify the existing elements of semantic segmentation in
a meta-learning framework.
A common approach how to improve the accuracy of
object recognition and segmentation is to use co-occurrence
statistics [9]. Originally used to analyze language [22], the
co-occurrence statistics can appear as a probabilistic general-
ization of the association analysis rule learning [23], [24].
Co-occurrence statistics represent information collected
from sample data and represents probabilistic information
about pairs of objects occurring together in one image. It
was used on several occasions to improve the recognition
accuracy in semantic segmentation and object recognition [9],
[12]. In particular it was used in combination with Conditional
Random Fields (CRF) [9], graph-cut [10] and with Algorithm
Selection approach [13], [25].
In most cases the co-occurrence is used only as existential
verifier, i.e. it represents only the statistical information of ob-
jects occurring at the same time. More advanced statistics have
been proposed in [13] where the co-occurrence statistics were
generalized to determine statistics of relative size, proximity,
position and shape.
The main problem of co-occurrence statistics is the proba-
bilistic bias that arises when calculating co-occurrence statis-
tics from a data set; i.e. objects occurring more often will tend
to bear stronger probabilistic presence than those that occur
less often. This becomes a problem if the co-occurrence model
or any statistics are used for generative purposes such as used
in [13].
The advantage of the co-occurrence methods is however the
relative easiness of using them and creating them from data.
Consequently co-occurrence statistics are very useful and can
be used both for verification as well as for model generation.
III. PROPOSED METHOD
In this paper we use the work from [12] as a starting point
of our study. The platform introduced in [12] is based on
meta-learning and uses algorithm selection to provide optimal
output to a computer vision task. As a part of feedback to the
algorithm selection mechanism, the content is verified using
higher-level relational co-occurrence matrices.
The platform was used in [25] and outperformed by in-
telligent algorithm selection all of the used state-of-the-art
semantic segmentation algorithms. Such result was obtained
despite the fact that the used semantic verification had a
accuracy of 60% for the 20 categories of objects available
in the VOC2012 dataset.
The general scheme of the verification method used in [25]
is shown in Figure 2.

Fig. 2. The process of semantic verification using object relationships.
The verification uses the result of semantic segmentation
such as shown in Figure 1, builds a relational model (called
high level representation in Figure 2) and determines if these
relations are semantically valid or lead to a contradiction.
For instance a human will never be in the air without the
support unless the context is specific to sky diving or jumping
in the air.
The main principle of this verification process is co-
occurrence statistics of four different kinds. These co-
occurrence statistics are used to determine the properties
between any two objects obtained as a result of semantic
segmentation. The collected information about objects were
represented as a vector for each pair of objects in the image.
Then from the set of all relationships a general conclusion on
the object configuration is obtained by majority voting or by
SVM. In the work used in this paper an SVM was trained to
discriminate whether yes or no a contradiction exists in the
semantic segmentation (Figure 3).
Unlike in simple co-occurrence statistics, the original work
from [13] uses four distinct measures to estimate the contra-
diction. The schematic representation of the original method is
shown in Figure 3. Unlike the work in [25] however in [13] the
accuracy of semantic verification was up to 92% of accuracy
but on a significantly smaller dataset and with specially
prepared data. Consequently the semantic verification based
on co-occurrence statistics should be studied in more depth to
understand better the capacity to capture and represents real
world information.
The five features obtained form semantic segmentation are
described as follows:
Fig. 3. Co-occurrences based Verification schematic of example
1) The first is simple co-occurrence collected from the
whole training data set. The result was a set of coeffi-
cient representing the probability that two objects occur
at the same time in one image.
2) The second is the position statistics. For this to work
each object in the image was segmented and center of
gravity was calculated. For each two pairs of objects
eight possible vector orientations were available. These
are shown in Figure 4.
3) The third co-occurrence was calculated using proximity
of objects. The coefficient indicating representing for
any two objects the probability that the two objects
are in visual contact. In fact in [25] the proximity
was integrated and was given as additional four co-
occurrence statistics: on, under, front and back.
4) The fourth co-occurrence is obtained from sizes of
objects. Similarly to the previous statistics, from the
segmented object the number of pixels is used as size.
The normalized average of the size ratio indicates the
probability of two objects relative sizes.
A shape characterization was added to increase the probability
of recognizing the segmented object with higher accuracy.
For this the shape histogram approach is used. The shape
histogram is simply created by sampling the boundary of
recognized object and clustering the distance of each sampled
object from the center of gravity.
An example image and a high level representation is shown
in Figure 4. Figure 4(a) shows three segmented objects in their
relative position. The objects’ gravity centers being the vertices
of a triangle are joined by the edges representing pairwise
relations between objects. The relations are represented by the
four relative co-occurrences relative distance (RDist), relative
size (RSize), relative proximity (RproX) and relative position
(RPos) as shown in Figure 4(b). The relative position is
ordered from left-to-right so that relative position L (left)
indicates the position of the left object with respect to the
right one and so on.
One of the main reasons of the low accuracy of the co-
occurrence statistics used for semantic verification is due to
statistical co-occurrence bias occurring because of lack of
training data with same number of objects of different classes.
For instance, because most of the images are human centric,
human is present in most of the images and thus all the

statistics are biased toward an over-presence of human.
In order to avoid this statistical co-occurrence based bias,
the proposed approach formulates n models of contextually
tinted models. The concept is simply explained as follows:
a co-occurrence statistics will depend on the context that
defines probability of certain objects occurring at all or in
some particular configuration.
A. Context Aware Verification
Considering the context, the environment and the general
specification of the application the verification process can be
broken from a single general verification algorithm to a larger
number of smaller verifiers. This idea is shown in Figure 5
where several context-aware verification models are used for
each of the existing defined contexts.
Figure 5 shows that for any input image, from the existing
semantic segmentation or provided by user a context is esti-
mated. The context is then used to select more accurate and
smaller version of the general verifier.
The idea of the proposed improvement in this paper is to
break the problem into categories or environments that allows
to reduce efficiently the size of the co-occurrence matrices by
eliminating objects that do not occur together or not at all.
For instance, from the VOC2012 data it was observed that
if there is a person on a horse it is always outside, while the
presence of cat is exclusively limited to inside environment.
Naturally such observation is highly depending on the
dataset but it is reasonable to assume that the database images
represent real objects in context proportionally to their natural
Fig. 5. Co-occurrences based Verification schematic of example
existence in real world. For instance, domesticated cats are
mostly inside while outside their occur much less often.
B. Selecting Contexts
Using the context characterization it is necessary to deter-
mine meaningful contexts that would allow improved verifica-
tion and simplified reasoning. For this we generated a new set
of visually relevant attributes for the VOC2012 data [26] set
called the Advanced Attributes VOC (AAVOC). There exists
already various augmented image sets by attribute however
in most of the cases these attributes are object related or a
particular view limited. Additionally the attributes are mostly
and only focused on the image primary objects rather to the
holistic properties of the environment. Consequently a new
data set was created for this purpose solving the two above
mentioned problems.
The used dataset provides thus the following improvements:
1) Object attributes labeling: only predefined attributes are
considered as being or not being present
2) Scene attributes relating to global scene properties such
as background or environment
3) Aperture attributes such as exposure quality or type of
photo shot
A total of 44 attributes have been used. Out of these twelve
are used to specify category of a given object and thus were
not used in the candidates of global contexts. The remaining 32
attributes have together 172 different values. Consequently the
provided labelling can be seen as having 172 binary attributes.
From each image in the AAVOC data set, each object was
extracted sequentially and the attributes were provided. Thus
according to the scopes of the attribute, for one image the
value of particular attribute can remain the same or change.
For each of the available labels, first the empty values
have been replaced by a placeholder. Then the entropy for
each attribute and the labels was calculated using the Shan-
non’s entropy the mutual information according to I(L,A) =
?
l?L
?
a?A p(l, a)log
(
p(l,a)
p(l)p(a)
)
where p(l) and p(a) are
prior probabilities of l ? L and a ? A.
The attributes we are looking for are such context variables
that best describes the data from a general point of view. The
attribute of highest interest should have thus the following
properties:
1) It has a defined value in all images
2) Values of the attribute are proportional to all images
3) Allows to estimate the classes of objects most reliably
For instance, environment location inside or outside is
example of such attribute that satisfied most of the criteria.
Specifically, any attribute specific to any object is in most cases
unsuitable because it is specific to either a type of object, a
group or a description.
The main rule for selecting such attribute is also one that has
defined values for all images and one that allows to best predict
and separate between classes of objects. For instance, an
attribute separating objects in two groups of non overlapping
sets is desired. Attribute inside will indeed put all sky in one
group (being not inside) and all TV monitors in another group
8being inside).
IV. EXPERIMENTATION
To evaluate the proposed method the VOC2012 challenge
dataset was used. Two subsets were used. The train subset
was used to build our models and the val dataset was used to
evaluate the proposed approach.
The verification framework is the one used in [13]. In
the proposed approach verification is required in order to
verify the semantic content of each semantic segmentation.
The method evaluation and accuracy of predicting semantic
contradiction from a segmentation results are shown in Table I
on the VOC 2012 validation dataset.

[10] 67%
[30] 39%
Average 66.8%
The accuracy of semantic segmentation represents a pixel-
wise difference between a ground truth semantic segmentation
and the algorithm’s result. An accuracy of 50% can represent
several different results: (a) exactly 50% of objects have been
perfectly segmented only and all others have not been even
detected, (b) the average accuracy of detecting and segmenting
images is 50% and (c) all objects were properly detected and
have been segmented with 50% of accuracy.
The original algorithm tested in [13], [25] had an accuracy
of detecting a contradiction of 60%. The algorithm was trained
and tested according to the description given in [13].
The experiments using the context based verification were
separated in two sets. First, an algorithm and context depen-
dent verification algorithm is implemented and was evaluated
on the validation data set of the VOC2012 dataset. The idea
behind this approach to semantic verification is to apply fine
grain verification able to trained for each available algorithm
individually. Such approach, could precisely detect seman-
tic segmentations contradictions resulting from the particular
structure and architecture of each algorithm.
In the second set of experiments, a more general approach
is used. Verification algorithms have been constructed only for
each of the available image contexts.
In order to evaluate the method on the simplest available
cases of scene configuration only images that contained single
instances of class were used for both training and testing.
Example and counter example of such images are shown in
Figure 6. Following the approach in [13] the used data to

train the verification algorithms were obtained from the tested
algorithms output. The valid images in Figure 6 represent
the negative examples for the training of the contradiction
detector. Positive examples are generated by removing one of
the available objects.
Table II shows the results and accuracy of a context and
algorithm dependent verification. Each row represents one
of the selected contexts and each column represents one
particular algorithm.
The results in the Table II shows that certain algorithms
are more consistent and thus more predictable than others.
In particular, three out of the five tested algorithm were

convolutional neural networks (CNN) [29], [28], [27] while the
two remaining ones are older algorithms based on Conditional
Random Fields (CRF) [10] and on machine learning of region
segmentation [30].
Interestingly, the accuracy of determining if an algorithm’s
semantic segmentation contains a semantic contradiction is
proportional to the average accuracy of the algorithm itself.
This indicates that the used contradiction detection method
principles are not capturing accurately and efficiently the
algorithm-dependent error structure.
To verify this claim another set of experiments was con-
ducted. This set of experiments was only context dependent
and the contradiction detection method was applied on the
semantic segmentation of all used algorithms. The results
are shown in Table III. Column one indicates the context,
column 2, 3 and 4 indicates the number of images used to
train the verifier, column five indicates the obtained accuracy
of predicting a contradiction, column six shows the results
reported in Table II and column seven shows the relative
improvement. The results from this second set of experiments

are shown in Table III. Interestingly the results show that
indeed he verification is same or even performs better when
performed in a algorithm independent manner rather than
when done on an algorithm by algorithm basis. This implies
that if there is an underlying structure to each algorithm’s
error then either it is negligible with respect to the context or
it cannot be properly captured by the model used here.
The general remarks on the results include the observa-
tion that while the improvement of the verification accuracy
compared to the initial result from [25] is considerable the
accuracy claimed in [13] was not achievable in any of the here
performed experiments. The conclusion from this observation
is that while in [13] the train and test data was the problem,
in [25] the problem was clearly the fact that single verifier for
all algorithms and all contexts is too complex and inaccurate.
Surprisingly splitting the verifier to a set of smaller ones
w.r.t. context and algorithms perform worse than only train
verifiers one for each available contexts. This is very inter-
esting because this indicates that the type of error obtained
as a result of semantic segmentation is strongly dependent on
the context of the image rather than on the type of the used
algorithms.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we showed a context based approach to
semantic segmentation content verification. We experimentally
demonstrated that the context is an important variable allowing
to strongly increase the accuracy of the verification while a
finer granularity of verification (algorithm dependent verifica-
tion) did not improve the accuracy.
Additionally we have experimentally shown that the most
important factor in increasing the accuracy of content verifi-
cation is indeed the context. Thus in the future work more
development in the area of automatic context extraction and
identification is to be studied and developed.
