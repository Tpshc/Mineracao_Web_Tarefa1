Abstract
Non-frontal lip views contain useful information which can be used to enhance the
performance of frontal view lipreading. However, the vast majority of recent lipreading
works, including the deep learning approaches which significantly outperform traditional
approaches, have focused on frontal mouth images. As a consequence, research on joint
learning of visual features and speech classification from multiple views is limited. In
this work, we present an end-to-end multi-view lipreading system based on Bidirectional
Long-Short Memory (BLSTM) networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
model which simultaneously learns to extract features directly from the pixels and per-
forms visual speech classification from multiple views and also achieves state-of-the-art
performance. The model consists of multiple identical streams, one for each view, which
extract features directly from different poses of mouth images. The temporal dynamics
in each stream/view are modelled by a BLSTM and the fusion of multiple streams/views
takes place via another BLSTM. An absolute average improvement of 3% and 3.8% over
the frontal view performance is reported on the OuluVS2 database when the best two
(frontal and profile) and three views (frontal, profile, 45?) are combined, respectively.
The best three-view model results in a 10.5% absolute improvement over the current
multi-view state-of-the-art performance on OuluVS2, without using external databases
for training, achieving a maximum classification accuracy of 96.9%.
1 Introduction
Lipreading, also known as visual speech recognition, is the process of recognising speech
by observing only the lip movements without having access to the audio signal. Several
approaches have been presented [10, 23, 28, 33] which extract features from a mouth region
of interest (ROI) and attempt to model their dynamics in order to recognise speech. Such a
system has the potential to enhance acoustic speech recognition in noisy environments since
the visual signal is not corrupted by acoustic noise and can also enable the use of silent
interfaces.

Recently, several deep learning approaches [7, 8, 24, 25, 26, 30] have been presented
which replace the traditional feature extraction process and automatically extract features
from the pixels. There are also a few end-to-end approaches which attempt to jointly learn
the extracted features and perform visual speech classification [5, 9, 27, 31]. This has given
rise to a second generation of lipreading systems based on deep learning which significantly
outperform the traditional approaches.
The vast majority of previous works has focused on frontal view lipreading. This is in
contrast to evidence in the literature that human lip-readers prefer non-frontal views [6, 18],
probably due to lip protrusion and lip rounding being more pronounced. It is therefore
reasonable to assume that non-frontal lip views contain useful information which can be
used to enhance the performance of frontal view lipreading or in cases where frontal view
of the mouth ROI is not available. This is especially true in realistic in-the-wild scenarios
where the face is rarely frontal. However, research on multi-view lipreading has been very
limited and mainly restricted to evaluating non-frontal views independently with few works
combining up to two views.
Such a system would be useful in meeting rooms where multiple cameras can record the
participants simultaneously. A car environment is another potential application where mul-
tiple cameras can be easily installed and multiple views are easily available. Finally, some
new smartphones have dual frontal cameras so that is another potential scenario although the
views will not be too far apart.
In this work, we present an end-to-end model which jointly learns to extract features
directly from the pixels and performs visual speech classification from multiple views. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end model which performs multi-view
lipreading and also achieves state-of-the-art performance. The proposed model consists of
multiple identical streams, one per view, which extract features directly from the raw images.
Each stream consists of an encoder which compresses the high dimensional input image to
a low dimensional representation. The encoding layers in each stream are followed by a
BLSTM which models the temporal dynamics. Finally, the information of the different
streams/views is fused via a BLSTM which also provides a label for each input frame.
The second contribution of this work is an extensive comparison of all possible com-
binations up to five views. We evaluate the proposed model on the OuluVS2 database [4],
which to the best of our knowledge is the only publicly available database containing 5 dif-
ferent views between 0?and 90?. We first perform an evaluation of each view independently
and we see that the frontal and profile views are the best single views. The combination of
these two views results in the best 2-view model which leads to a 3% absolute increase in
classification accuracy over the frontal view. The addition of the 45?view results in a fur-
ther small improvement of 0.8% over the best 2-view model. This means that multi-view
lipreading can indeed enhance the performance of frontal view lipreading. However, the ad-
dition of more views (4 or 5) does not lead to any further improvements. We also show that
non-frontal combinations like 30?or 45?and 90?outperform the frontal view which means
that such combinations can be successfully used when frontal lip views are not available.
Finally, in all single-view or multi-view scenarios the proposed model improves the state-of-
the-art performance and achieves a maximum classification accuracy of 96.9% which is the
highest performance reported on the OuluVS2 database.

view is used for feature extraction directly from the raw images. Each stream consists of
an encoder which compresses the high dimensional input image to a low dimensional repre-
sentation. The ? and ?? features are also computed and appended to the bottleneck layer.
The encoding layers in each stream are followed by a BLSTM which models the temporal
dynamics. A BLSTM is used to fuse the information from all streams and provides a label
for each input frame.
2 Related Work
Previous works can be grouped into three categories: 1) evaluation of different views, 2)
pose-invariant lipreading and 3) multi-view lipreading. The first group contains works which
evaluate non-frontal views individually and compare their performance with the frontal view.
It is not possible to draw a conclusion as to which is the most informative view since con-
flicting results are presented in the literature. Early works considered only frontal and profile
views. Lucey and Potamianos [20] report a moderate performance degradation when profile
view is used compared to frontal view. On the other hand, Kumar et al. [16] show results
where the profile view outperforms the frontal view. Recently, few studies considering more
views have been published. Lan et al. [17] evaluated 5 different views, 0?, 30?, 45?, 60?and
90?, for lipreading and showed that their system performed best at 30?. The same 5 views
have been evaluated on the OuluVS2 database and the results are still conflicting. The frontal
view was found to be the best by Saitoh et al. [29], the profile view by Lee at al. [19], the
30?view by Zimmermann et al. [34] and the 60?view was found to be the best performing in
[3]. The results presented by Saitoh et al. provide some insight as to why this may happen.

Three different convolutional neural networks (CNNs), GoogLeNet, AlexNet and Network
in Network, were trained on OuluVS2 using data augmentation. Each model led to different
performance across the views. This is probably an indication that the best view depends on
the model and maybe even the features used. This could explain the different conclusions
reached by different studies.
Pose-invariant lipreading works belong to the second group. The main goal of such works
is to reduce the impact of different poses as it is known that the performance decreases in
mismatched train/test conditions, i.e., the classifier is trained and tested on different poses.
There are two main approaches in the literature for pose-invariant lipreading. The first one
trains classifiers using data from all available views in order to build a generic classifier [22].
The second approach applies a mapping to transform features from non-frontal views to the
frontal view. Lucey et al. [21] apply a linear mapping to transform profile view features to
frontal view features. This approach has been extended to mapping other views like 30?,
45?and 60?to the frontal view [11] or to the 30?view [17]. This approach makes it possible
to collect a large amount of data on the optimal view and train a robust model. However, as
the number of features to be generated by the linear mapping increases the performance is
degraded [21].
To the best of our knowledge, there are only three works which have attempted multi-
view lipreading, i.e., using multiple views of the lips simultaneously. Lucey and Potamianos
[20] concatenated discrete cosine transform features extracted from frontal and profile views
and fed them to a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The performance of the 2-view system
outperformed the frontal view model. Lee et al. [19] experimented with different CNN ar-
chitectures which takes as input multiple lip views. The CNNs were combined with LSTMs
and trained end-to-end on the OuluVS2 database. They just tested the combination of all 5
views which turned out to be worse than the frontal and profile views, possibly due to lack of
enough training data. Finally, Zimmermann et al. [34] used principal componenent analysis
(PCA) networks together with LSTMs and HMMs in order to combine multiple views from
the OuluVS2 database. The only combination which outperformed the frontal view is frontal
+ 30?. Similarly to [19], the combination of all views led to worse performance than most
individual views.
3 End-to-End Multi-view Lipreading
The proposed deep learning system for multi-view lipreading is shown in Fig. 1. It consists
of three identical streams which extract features directly from the raw input images. Each
stream corresponds to one view and consists of two parts: an encoder and a BLSTM. The
encoder follows a bottleneck architecture in order to compress the high dimensional input
image to a low dimensional representation at the bottleneck layer. The same architecture as
in [14] is used, with 3 fully connected hidden layers of sizes 2000, 1000 and 500, respec-
tively, followed by a linear bottleneck layer. The rectified linear unit is used as the activation
function for the hidden layers. The ? (first derivatives) and ?? (second derivatives) [32]
features are also computed, based on the bottleneck features, and they are appended to the
bottleneck layer. In this way, during training we force the encoding layers to learn compact
representations which are discriminative for the task at hand but also produce discrimina-
tive ? and ?? features. This is in contrast to the traditional approaches which pre-compute
the ? and ?? features at the input level and as a consequence there is no control over their
discriminative power.

The second part is a BLSTM layer added on top of the encoding layers in order to model
the temporal dynamics associated with each view. The BLSTM outputs of each stream are
concatenated and fed to another BLSTM in order to fuse the information from all streams
and model the temporal dynamics associated with all views. The output layer is a softmax
layer which provides a label for each input frame. The entire system is trained end-to-end
which enables the joint learning of features and classifier. In other words, the encoding layers
learn to extract features from raw images which are useful for classification using BLSTMs.
3.1 Single Stream Training
Initialisation: First, each stream/view is trained independently. The encoding layers are
pre-trained in a greedy layer-wise manner using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)
[13]. Since the input (pixels) is real-valued and the hidden layers are either rectified linear
or linear (bottleneck layer) four Gaussian RBMs [13] are used. Each RBM is trained for
20 epochs with a mini-batch size of 100 and L2 regularisation coefficient of 0.0002 using
contrastive divergence. The learning rate is fixed to 0.001 as suggested in [13] when the
visible/hidden units are linear.
End-to-End Training: Once the encoder has been pretrained then the BLSTM is added on
top and its weights are initialised using glorot initialisation [12]. The Adam training algo-
rithm is used for end-to-end training with a mini-batch size of 10 utterances. The default
learning rate of 0.001 led to unstable training so it was reduced to 0.0003. Early stopping
with a delay of 5 epochs was also used in order to avoid overfitting and gradient clipping
was applied to the LSTM layers.
3.2 Multi-Stream Training
Initialisation: Once the single streams have been trained then they are used for initialising
the corresponding streams in the multi-stream architecture. Then another BLSTM is added
on top of all streams in order to fuse the single stream outputs. Its weights are initialised
using glorot initialisation.
End-to-End Training: Finally, the entire network is trained jointly using Adam [15], 0.0001,
to fine-tune the entire network. Early stopping and gradient clipping were also applied simi-
larly to single stream training.
4 Experiments
The database used in this study is the OuluVS2 [4] which to the best of our knowledge is the
only publicly available database with 5 lip views between 0?and 90?. It contains 52 speakers
saying 10 utterances, 3 times each, so in total there are 156 examples per utterance. The
utterances are the following: Excuse me, Goodbye, Hello, How are you, Nice to
meet you, See you, I am sorry, Thank you, Have a good time, You are welcome.

The mouth ROIs are provided and they are downscaled as shown in Table 1 in order to keep
the aspect ratio of the original videos constant.
We first partition the data into training, validation and test sets. The protocol suggested
by the creators of the OuluVS2 database is used [29] where 40 subjects are used for training
and validation and 12 for testing. We randomly divided the 40 subjects into 35 and 5 subjects
for training and validation purposes, respectively. This means that there are 1050 training
utterances, 150 validation utterances and 360 test utterances.
The target classes are a one-hot encoding for the 10 utterances. Each frame is labelled
based on the label of the utterance and the end-to-end model is trained with these labels. The
model provides a label for each frame and the majority label over each utterance is used in
order to label the entire sequence.
Since all experiments are subject independent we first need to reduce the impact of sub-
ject dependent characteristics. This is done by subtracting the mean image, computed over
the entire utterance, from each frame. The next step is the normalisation of data. As recom-
mended in [13] the data should be z-normalised, i.e. the mean and standard deviation should
be equal to 0 and 1 respectively, before training an RBM with linear input units. Hence, each

Due to randomness in initialisation, every time a deep network is trained the results vary.

The proposed model was developed in Theano [1] using the Lasagne [2] library. The

4.1 Results on OuluVS2
4.1.1 Single-View Results
In the single view scenario, we train and test models on data recorded from a single view.
This means that only a single stream is used from the model shown in Fig. 1. Table 2 shows
the mean classification accuracy and standard deviation of the 10 models trained for each
view. The best performance is achieved by the frontal and profile views followed by the 45?,
30?and 60?views.
In almost all previous works just a single accuracy value is provided, which is most likely
the maximum performance achieved, with no standard deviation. In order to facilitate a fair
comparison, we also provide the maximum performance achieved over the 10 runs in Table
3 together with previous results. It is obvious that even our mean performance is consistently
higher for all views than previous works, which do not use external data for training. When it
comes to maximum performance the proposed end-to-end architecture sets the new state-of-
the-art for all views. It is worth pointing out, that the proposed system outperforms even the
CNN models [7], [8] trained using external data. Both models are pre-trained on the BBC
dataset [7], which is a large dataset, and fine-tuned on OuluVS2.

4.1.2 Multi-view Results
In the multi-view scenario, we train and test models on data recorded from multiple views.
Table A1 shows the mean classification accuracy and standard deviation over 10 runs for
combinations of two views. Due to lack of space we present only the six best combinations
and the other four are shown in the supplementary material. The combination of frontal and
profile views is the best 2-view combination resulting in a 3% absolute increase in classifica-
tion accuracy over the frontal view. The only other combinations that outperform the frontal
one are the following: 0?+ 45?, 45?+ 90?, 30?+ 90?. It is beneficial to combine a frontal (0?)
or partially frontal (30?or even 45?) view, which contains information mostly about the lips
appearance, with a side (90?) or partially side (45?) which contains information mostly about
lip protrusion. It is also evident that combining neighbouring views is not useful since there
is not enough complementary information. Finally, it is worth pointing out that although a
60?view is a partially side view its combination with any other view is not beneficial. This
is because it is the worst performing view as can be seen in Table 2.
Table 5 shows the maximum performance over the 10 runs for the 2-view combinations.
To the best of our knowledge only Zimmerman et al. [34] present results on 2-view lipreading
on OuluVS2. It is clear that the proposed end-to-end model significantly outperforms [34]
and sets the new state-of-the-art maximum performance for all combinations of 2 views.
Table 6 shows the results of the four best 3-view combinations, the rest can be found in
the supplementary material. All four combinations outperform the frontal view performance
up to 3.8%, however only 0?+ 45?+ 90?results in a statistically significant improvement of
0.8% over the best 2-view combination (frontal + profile). Results for the combinations of
4 views and all views can be found in the supplementary material. All combinations outper-
form the frontal view up to 3.8%, however none of them results in a statistically significant
improvement over the best 3-view combination. This reveals that 2-view lipreading leads
to the biggest improvement over frontal view lipreading, and the addition of a third view
offers a further small improvement but addition of more views does not really offer any
performance benefit.
We should also point out that the maximum performance achieved of 96.9% is the highest
classification accuracy reported on the short phrases part of OuluVS2, outperforming the
previous state-of-the-art accuracy of 86.4% achieved by [19] (see Table 3) when no external
data are used. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art performance of 94.1%, when external
data are used for training, reported in [8] (see Table 5).
Fig. 2 shows the classification accuracy per subject for the best single-view, 2-view and
3-view combinations, respectively. We observe that for all subjects except 34 the combi-
nations of frontal and profile views and frontal + 45?+ profile results in similar or better

performance than the frontal view. It is clear that there is not a very large performance devi-
ation across the different test subjects. All of them except 6 achieve a classification accuracy
over 90% with 5 of them (8, 9, 26, 30, 44) achieving 100%.
Fig. 3 shows the confusion matrices for the best single-view, 2-view and 3-view combi-
nations, respectively. It is clear that the number of confusions is reduced when multiple views
are considered. The most common confusion pair in the single view is between Hello
(3rd phrase) and Thank you (8th phrase) which is consistent with confusions presented
in [19, 27]. This is followed by confusions between See you (6th phrase) and Hello,
Goodbye (2nd phrase) and You are welcome (10th phrase), You are welcome and
How are you (4th phrase).
Finally, we should also mention that we experimented with CNNs for the encoding layers
but this led to worse performance than the proposed system. Chung and Zisserman [7]
report that it was not possible to train a CNN on OuluVS2 without the use of external data.
Similarly, Saitoh et al. [29] report that they were able to train CNNs on OuluVs2 only after
data augmentation was used. This is likely due to the rather small training set. We also
experimented with data augmentation which improved the performance but did not exceed
the performance of the proposed system.

5 Conclusion
In this work, we present an end-to-end multiview lipreading system which jointly learns to
extract features directly from the pixels and performs classification using BLSTM networks.
Results on the OuluVS2 demonstrate that the combination of multiple views is indeed ben-
eficial for lipreading. The combination of the frontal and profile views leads to significant
improvement over the frontal view. Further addition of the 45?view leads to a further small
increase in performance. However, addition of more views does not lead to any further im-
provement. We have also demonstrated that combinations of non-frontal views, like 30?or
45?and 90?, can outperform the frontal view which is useful in cases where frontal lip views
are not available. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OuluVS2
without using external data for training or even data augmentation. However, we should
stress that the provided mouth ROIs are well cropped and this might not be the case when
automatic tools for mouth ROI detection are used. It is well known that the accuracy of
automatic detectors might degrade with non-frontal views so it would be interesting to in-
vestigate the impact of automatic mouth ROI cropping on multi-view lipreading. Finally, the
model can be easily extended to multiple streams so we are planning to add an audio stream
in order to evaluate its performance on audiovisual multi-view speech recognition.
