Abstract—Image analysis methods that are based on exact 
blur values are faced with the computational complexities due to 
blur measurement error. This atmosphere encourages scholars to 
look for handcrafted and learned features for finding depth from 
a single image. This paper introduces a novel exact realization for 
blur measures on digital images and implements it on a new 
measure of defocus Gaussian blur at edge points in Depth From 
Defocus (DFD) methods with the potential to change this 
atmosphere. The experiments on real images indicate superiority 
of the proposed measure in error performance over conventional 
learned features in the state-of the-art single image based depth 
estimation methods.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Blur measurement error increases the computational 
complexity of DFD, and encourages the community of research 
to look for intuitive nondeterministic approaches in artificial 
intelligence to find depth of a scene from its images. The most 
related field under this demand is depth oriented image 
segmentation. In contrast to DFD this approach does not 
consider the relative blur between two images due to depth, but 
invests on the labelling the depth in a single image. This 
approach has involved with high complexities for depth 
finding.  
For inferring depth from a single image a complete 
database of the world images is required with their 3-D 
coordinates. This is running in literature and highlighted in [1] 
for integration all present RGB Depth databases.  The research 
in  [2] exploited the availability of a pool of images with 
known depth to formulate depth estimation as an optimization 
problem. The methods for estimating depth from a single 
image are commissioned to touch the human skills on inferring 
3D structure or depth. The evolution road of the present 
methods, which is tightened by enforcing geometric 
assumptions to infer the spatial layout of a room in [3] and [4] 
or outdoor scenes in [5], is being expanded by handcrafted 
features in [2], [6], [7], [8] and [9] for more general scenes. 
Most limitations are supposed to be diminished by learning 
features in the multi layers of Convolutional Neural Networks 
(CNN) [10], [11], [12] which  infer directly depth map from 
the image pixel values. In the current literature, there is no 
basic difference between depth estimation and semantic 
labelling, as jointly performing both can benefit each other [7]. 
The possibility of generating semantic labelling with the 
information to guide depth perception given in [13] supports 
the legality of the multistage inferring process in CNN. 
Both handcrafted and learned features based depth 
estimation from a single image methods, suffer from high 
complexity in depth inferring process and in adapting (tuning 
or training) the model parameters. Changing the model from 
handcrafted features to CNN shifts the complexity in the depth 
inferring process from retrieval time to calculation architecture. 
Both the adaptation and the inferring complexities increase 
with the number and size of the input images. However, DFD 
methods are able to provide a closed form formula for depth of 
a local image independent of the size and number of the input 
images, with insignificant processing time.  These advantages 
can switch back depth finding methods from handcrafted and 
learned features to DFD measures, provided that both 
approaches lead to comparable results. This statement is 
quantified here in terms of measurement error by improving 
the blur measures in DFD.  
Regardless of all environmental sources of error in DFD, 
formulating blur measurement is expected to be free of internal 
error. Inductive replacing differentials with differences on 
discrete implementations is conventional  source of the blur 
measurement error in DFD formulation. This error should be 
eliminated for effective comparing the performance of DFD 
against conventional learned features in single image based 
methods 
This paper contributes the DFD methods first by 
introducing the exact discrete realization of a general blur 
measure on digital images, and then by presenting a new blur 
measure in the exact form with interesting results for 
comparing DFD with the single image based methods. Problem 
formulation is based on the image formation model given in the 
next section. In the following sections the exact discrete 
realization is applied on a well-accepted conventional blur 
measure in literature and the improvement due to that is 
quantified. Then, the new blur measure is induced of the exact 
realisation for the present blur measure. The proposed blur 
measure is compared first with the exact realisation and then 
with the state-of the-art single image based depth estimation 
methods over the test images of the Make3D  range image 
dataset [8]. Comparison results simplify the decision for 
selecting the proposed measure of blur or conventional learned 
features for depth finding. 
II. DFD IMAGE FORMATION MODEL 
DFD obtains depth by modelling the depth dependent blur 
or defocus Point Spread Function (PSF). The method obtains 
depth by estimating the scale of the PSF at each image point 
using a raw blur measure. In DFD theory, the defocused image 
of a scene point ?(?, ?) is obtained by convolving the focused 
image ?(?, ?) with the PSF ?(?, ?) as  
 ?(?, ?) = ?(?, ?) ? ?(?, ?), (1)  
The blur parameter ? is a space-variant that represents depth 
variations over the scene. Relying on the central limit theorem, 
it is usually assumed that the defocus PSF is a Gaussian 
function as  
 
?(?, ?) =
1
2? ?2(?, ?)
?
?
?2+?2
2?2(?,?). (2)  
The analytic approaches in DFD obtain depth by solving 
the equations of the blur values over two images of a scene at 
different settings for the imaging system.  In most general cases 
there are two equations: the first is a linear equation that 
depends on the camera settings[14], and the second one sets the 
difference between the squared blur values to its analytic 
measures over the images.  These are called camera-based and 
image-based DFD equation pairs, with the solutions for the 
objective blur or depth dependent blur of both image points. 
The image based equation is obtained by local computing on 
the images based on an analysis in the frequency( [15] , [16] 
and [17]) or spatial domain ([[18], [19] and [20]). 
In the exceptional cases of the scene focussed image with 
the  step edges [21], with sharp textures [22], or with the 
gradient described by the white Gaussian distribution random 
process [23], one image will be enough to measure the 
objective blur, the depth dependent blur, or  the likelihood of a 
candidate defocus scale, respectively. Modelling the image 
gradient by the white Gaussian random process is a creative 
technique  for the blur estimation in a closed form,  regard to 
all dependencies to the image contents. Although, the method 
is enriched by smoothness and colour edge information, its 
applications does not extends beyond the labelling  for 
foreground/background segmentation [24]. This method does 
not measure, but selects the maximum likelihood local defocus 
scale of a given set, and it does not guarantee labelling the 
image patches by true values of scale. 
 In [21], the blur measure at the edge locations is related 
analytically to the gradient  between the input image and re-
blurred version of that. These images are replaced with two 
different re-blurred versions of the input image in [25] and [26] 
by hard assumption on the PSF which is confirmed more by the 
smaller values of blur. It will be shown that this range of blur 
values are faced with the most measurement errors.   
This paper locates a point in an image by Canny edge 
detector and validates it for measuring the blur when there is 
just one edge orientation inside the respected measurement 
circle which is considered with the radius of three pixel width 
centred on that point. A valid local image for measuring the 
blur is modelled by a step edge that is defocused consecutively 
by two Gaussian blur functions. First with the Inherent or 
subjective blur ?s that makes the original focused image of a 
scene with non-sharp edge, then with the depth dependent or  
objective blur ?o.  The result is similar to blurring the step edge 
with the Gaussian PSF by the absolute blur ? = ???
2 + ??
2.  
In this model the operator of the DFD image based equation 
makes equal outputs for the absolute and for the depth 
dependent blur values over two given images of a local area 
with the same ??. Therefore, an estimator of the absolute blur 
value is enough for the image based DFD equation.   
 To measure the absolute blur value over an image, a circle 
with the radius of three pixel width for the local measurements 
is centred at each pixel, and it is assumed that the blur value is 
fixed over that. The blur measure operator is applied to all the 
validated local images. Including the subjective blur in the 
objective, the focused image with the grey level range 
(???? , ????) of a valid local image can be described by the 2-D 
step function as ?(?, ?) = (?????????)?(?) + ???? in the 
local image. Convolving this by the defocus  PSF with 
?(?, ?) = ? in ?(2), makes the defocused image given  by ?(?) 
as 
 ?(?, ?) = ?(?, ?) ? ?(?, ?) 
= ???? +
?????????

(1 + ??? (

)) ? ?(?), 
(3)  
where ??? is the error function defined  by ?(4).

III. CONVENTIONAL AND EXACT BLUR MEASURES 
This section abstracts the analytic blur measure in [21] to 
introduce the exact discrete value for that, then modifies the 
result to a new blur measure with less complexity and higher 
error performance. The proposed measure in [21] is based on 
the gradient ratio between the input image and re-blurred 
version of that. The magnitude of the gradient of ?(?) in ?(3) is  
 
|??(?)| =
??(?)
??
=
?????????
?2??
??? (
??2
2?2
) (5)  
and the re-blurred version of ?(?) by the Gaussian kernel with 
the standard deviation  ?1 is ?(6). 
 
?1(?) = ???? +
?????????
2
(1 + ??? (
?
?2?(?2 + ?1
2)
)) (6)  
The magnitude of the gradient of ?1(?) is obtained as ?(7)  
 
|??1(?)| =
?????????
?2?(?2 + ?1
2)
??? (
??2
2(?2 + ?1
2)
) (7)  
The gradient ratio between the input and re-blurred images at 
the edge location ? = 0 leads to  ?(8). 
 
??(?) =
|??(0)|
|??1(0)|
= ?
?2 + ?1
2
?2
 (8)  
With the known value of ?1 the blur value is estimated by ?(9). 
 ???(??) =
 ?1
???
2 ? 1
 (9)  
The exact discrete value of ??(?) is obtained as ???(?) 
in ?(10), by using the discrete approximation of the absolute 
gradient in ?(8). 
 
???(?) =
?(1) ? ?(0)
?1(1) ? ?1(0)
=
??? (
1
?2?
)
??? (
1
?2(?2 + ?1
2)
)
 (10)  
The blur value is estimated by applying the inverse function of 
???(?) on the computed ????  as ?(11).  
 ???? = ???
?1(???) (11)  
For the noise free image with the proposed model of image 
formation the relation ??? = ???(?) leads to ???? = ?. In the 
case of noisy images ???? will be deviated from ? by noise 
effects. 
This paper introduces a new blur measure similar to RG 
without re-blurring input image. The concept of variation of the 
re-blurred image in the asymmetric range (0,1) in the 
denominator of the fraction for RGd in ?(10) can be replaced 
with that of the input image in the symmetric range (?1,1). 
For the corresponding nominator which is needed to be greater 
than the denominator, the variation range (?2,2) is a good 
candidate.  Following this induction, the new measure of blur 
with the exact discrete format is introduced as ?(12).  
 
???(?) =
?(2) ? ?(?2)
?(1) ? ?(?1)
=
??? (
?2
?
)
??? (
1
?2?
)
 (12)  
The blur value is estimated by the reverse function in ?(13). 
 ???? = ???
?1(???) (13)  
Implementing (12) requires edge locating which is done by 
Canny edge detector, and edge orientation which is done by 
maximising the image intensity variations inside the 
measurement circle. 
The blur measure RG(?), its exact discrete value RGd(?) 
and  the new blur measure MGd(?) are plotted in Fig. 1.a.  
???(?) and ???(?) in ?(11) and ?(13) make the exact value of ? 
from monotonic functions of ? for ? > 0.42 pixel width. More 
precisely for the exact values of blur measures, RGd for 
? > 0.42 and  MGd for ? > 0 are monotonic. In the monotone 
range all blur measures are invertible, but just the inverse of   
???(?) and ???(?) will make the exact value of ? from 
discrete local image samples. The results in Fig. 1.a  indicate 
unbounded difference between the blur measure ?? and its 
exact discrete value ??? for infinite small values of ?. 
Therefore, the mistake on using ?? instead of ??? will lead to 
catastrophic measurement error on estimating the small values 
of ? from  discrete local image samples. 
The blur measures RGd(?) and MGd(?) can be compared 
graphically in Fig. 1.a. The size of both the variation range, and 
the monotone range enclosed by the variation range indicate 
the power of resolving blur values by the measures. For the 
both cases the proposed blur measure MGd advances on RGd. 
The size of variation range of MGd(?)  is approximately twice 
that of RGd(?). This feature and no need to re blurring the 
input image indicate the preference of MGd(?) to RGd(?) for 
depth finding.  
IV. PROMOTION IN ERROR PERFORMANCE 
Replacing any conventional blur measure with its exact 
discrete value in blur estimation reduces the blur measurement 
error.  The amount of error reduction is quantified for the blur 
measure ?? as follows. The error is caused by applying ?(9) for 
estimating ? with the discrete blur measure  ???. Therefore, 
the relative blur measurement will be given by ?(14),  
 
???(?) = |
 ???(???) ? ?
?
| = ||
 ?1/?
????
2(?) ? 1
? 1|| (14)  
As ??? in ?(10)  is a known function of the blur value ?, in the 
proposed image formation model ???  will be a known function 
of ? and the reblurring parameter ?1.  
For other image formation models and in the presence of 
noise, ??? in ?(10)  is a known function of the image samples 
and  ???  as a function of ??? in ?(14) represents the 
measurement error caused by the image noise and deviation 
from the proposed model.  In this case  RG could be assumed as 
an heuristic blur measure free of Gaussian assumption on the 
 
  
(a) (b) 
Fig. 1. (a) Variation of blur measures versus the blur values. (b) The blur measurement error caused by conventional  discretizing the blur 
measure ??. 
 
 
PSF. ??? , as shown in Fig. 1.b, is unbounded in accordance 
with  RG for infinite small values of blur, and is not fairly low 
in a wide range of blur values. Therefore its average on any 
blur range expressed by (0, ????) is not theoretically limited.  
V. EXPERIMENT RESULTS 
The analytic results in the previous sections demonstrated 
theoretically superiority of the exact discrete values of blur 
measures over the conventional ones and that of the proposed 
measure over the present one for the images described by ?(3) in 
absence of noise. An experiment is planned on real images to 
compare the exact discrete value of the proposed blur measure 
with the  state-of the-art single image based depth estimation 
methods.  More specifically, the error performance of MGd 
over the test images of the Make3D  range image dataset [8] is 
obtained to compare with the results reported by these 
methods. The dataset contains images of natural scenes in the 
size of 2272x1704 and corresponding depth maps with the 
resolution of 55x305. Therefore, depth values are assumed to 
be known in none overlapping rectangular 41x5 superpixels 
that cover the rectangle area in size of 2256x1526 in the middle 
part of the given images. This dataset has been experimented in 
literature and the mean absolute relative error has been reported 
53%  in  [27], 37% in [8], 37.5% in [2], 36.2%  in [6], 33.8% 
in [9], and 30.7%  in [10]  and [11], for that. 
Given an RGBD input image for the blur measurement, the 
depth map of that denoted by ?(?, ?) is applied for making a 
space-variant blur parameter ?(?, ?) by  
 ?(?, ?)  = ? + ? ???(?(?, ?)). (15)  
This model provides depth independent error for ? as ?? due 
to the error in the range finding for depth map when the 
relative error ??/? is fixed over the whole range of ?. The 
model can be fitted locally on the model ??? + ???/?(?, ?) in 
Geometric Optics for applying with the camera settings. The 
parameters c and d are determined by aligning the extreme 
values of  ? and D in the ranges  ?min ? ? ? ?max and  
Dmin ? D ? Dmax by the corresponding pairs (Dmin, ?min) 
and (Dmax, ?max).  Dmin and Dmax are available in the depth 
data, and (?min, ?max) is set at  (0.5,10) to ensure of the blur 
measure being in a proper monotone measurement range as in 
Fig. 1.a. The minimum value is in favour of less error in low 
blur values with the cost of less resolution for large values. The 
Gaussian blur function ?(?, ?) in ?(2) is applied on the input 
image to obtain the defocused pair of the input image and make 
the DFD image pairs. Based on two measures of blur, ???1 
over the original input image and  ???2 over the defocused  
image, the objective blur ? of the defocused image due to depth 
at the edge points is estimated by  
 ???2(?, ?) = ????
2(???2(?, ?)) ? ????
2(???1(?, ?)). (16)  
And, the estimation of the depth map at the edge points of the 
original input image will be  
 ???(?, ?) = Exp (
???(?,?)?c
d
). (17)  
For obtaining the depth map with same resolution as the 
original one, the depth values over all pixels of each superpixel 
is set to the average of the estimated values at edge locations, 
or set to Dmax for those superpixels without detected edge 
point. 
The experiment was run over the whole test images of the 
Make3D  dataset. The difference between the pixel resolution 
in images and the superpixel resolution in depth maps helps to 
increase the density of depth estimation at edge points. While 
the fraction of the valid points on the original RGB images was 
obtained in average less than 6%, the figure for the the depth 
maps was more than 57%.  The mean absolute relative error 
over the depth map of all 134 test images was found as 27.5% 
in average. The result is better than that of  the published

methods from a single image. 
Fig. 2 has grouped the experiment results on two samples 
of the test images in the half left and half right part of the 
figure. The original image of the dataset, the defocussed image 
by depth dependent blur, the original depth map, and the 
estimated depth map are shown in each group. For the edgeless 
superpixels the estimated depth values are set to Dmax in  Fig. 
2.d to attain convenient visualization on the results. The 
reduction in the number of valid points for depth finding is 
firmly compensated by propagating the detected edge points in 
each superpixel to the all pixels inside that with same depth 
value. For the  experiment in the left part 3.1% of the  pixels in 
the original image are detected as the edge points, while the 
depth map is estimated for more than 43.4% of the superpixels 
at the resolution of the original dept map.  The mean absolute 
relative error is obtained as 11% over the mentioned 
superpixels. The corresponding figures for the right part is 
6.4%, 71% and 18.8%.  
VI. CONCLUSION 
Exact discrete formulation led to introduce the exact 
realisation for the present blur measure RG(?) as RGd(?) and 
the new blur measure MGd(?) in the exact form. The amount of 
reduction in measurement error caused by the exact value of 
the bur measure RG(?) was quantified in Fig. 1.b. Then, the 
proposed blur measure MGd(?)  was compared in error 
performance with RGd(?) and with the conventional learned 
features in the state-of the-art single image based depth 
estimation methods. Experiment results demonstrated the 
superiority of  the proposed measure over the exact value of the 
present measure and over the  conventional learned features in 
literature.
