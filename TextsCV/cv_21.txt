Abstract— The use of 3D and stereo imaging is rapidly 
increasing. Compression, transmission, and processing could 
degrade the quality of stereo images. Quality assessment of such 
images is different than their 2D counterparts. Metrics that 
represent 3D perception by human visual system (HVS) are 
expected to assess stereoscopic quality more accurately. In this 
paper, inspired by brain sensory/motor fusion process, two stereo 
images are fused together. Then from every fused image two 
synthesized images are extracted. Effects of different distortions 
on statistical distributions of the synthesized images are shown. 
Based on the observed statistical changes, features are extracted 
from these synthesized images. These features can reveal type 
and severity of distortions.  Then, a stacked neural network 
model is proposed, which learns the extracted features and 
accurately evaluates the quality of stereo images. This model is 
tested on 3D images of popular databases. Experimental results 
show the superiority of this method over state of the art stereo 
image quality assessment approaches.

I. INTRODUCTION 
OWADAYS, with the expansion of communication 
through internet and other communication networks, high 
volume of media is being transferred. The quality of 
delivered images needs to be assured using visual media 
quality assessment (QA). Although most sensible methods for 
determining the quality of images and video are subjective 
assessment, they are impractical due to being laborious, costly, 
and time-consuming. Moreover, subjective assessment is 
inefficient for real-time applications and always depends on 
physical, emotional and individual differences of people [1]. 
Therefore, a lot of research has been done to design an 
automated computational model for objective quality

assessment of images [2-6]. Since any proposed model must 
estimate scores close to subjective ratings, successful 
objective methods have high correlated results with human 
observations.  
The popularity of three-dimensional images and videos in 
recent years is increasing [7]. The number of three-
dimensional movies increases at least 50% each year [8]. In 
addition to movies, 3D televisions and cameras have become 
commonplace. Scientific applications, medical and military 
usage of 3D images are not negligible. Therefore, it is 
expected that in the near future 3D media covers a large 
portion of all transferred data. Hence, monitoring and quality 
protection of visual content for such images is one of the new 
challenges ahead. So far, extensive research has been done to 
determine the quality of 2D images [2-6], but research in the 
field of 3D images is relatively recent [9-40]. Appropriate, 
efficient, and fast solutions for assessment of such images can 
help development of 3D imaging applications. With the 
addition of depth as the third dimension, new issues such as 
depth perception, visual discomfort, visual fatigue and visual 
perception arise that make 3D Stereo Image Quality 
Assessment (SIQA) much more complex than its 2D 
counterpart. These issues make 3D visual quality assessment 
very sensitive and quite challenging field of research. 
Therefore, using routines developed for 2D images is 
inappropriate for 3D images and new methods are required to 
address this problem [9]. 
The distortion topic in stereo images covers many details such 
as visual discomfort, unbalanced depth perception and visual 
fatigue due to incorrect stereography. The scenario of SIQA 
assesses the quality of stereo images that independently or 
simultaneously (symmetric or asymmetric) have been affected 
by distortions such as compression, noise or camera artifacts. 
Distorted images are well-calibrated, which means there is no 
problem in terms of camera angles and stereography settings. 
Similar to 2D images, 3D visual quality evaluation methods 
are divided into three following categories based on the need 
of the method to access the original (reference) image: 
1) Full-reference (FR) models need the original image pair to 
assess the quality of degraded image pair.  
2) Reduced-Reference (RR) methods have access to some 
features or some information about the original images. 
3) Unlike the first two categories, No-Reference (NR) 
algorithms estimate visual quality of degraded stereo 
images without any information or any need to the 
reference images.

Since the original versions of received signals from 
communication channels are not available in most cases, NR 
IQA methods are more practical than the other two categories. 
In the case of stereo images, availability of reference images 
means having both the left and right images. The application 
of FR SIQA methods is more limited than the application of 
FR 2D methods. Therefore, NR and RR methods are the main 
priority of stereo quality assessment systems. Despite 2D NR 
QA methods which produce comparable results to 2D FR ones 
[4-6], 3D NR QA approaches are not as strong as 3D FR 
methods. 
From another perspective, QA techniques can be divided into 
two categories of general purpose and application specific 
techniques. General purpose methods estimate the degree of 
image quality, independent of the type of distortion. These 
methods are flexible and are based on common characteristics 
and assumptions about human visual system. Application 
specific criteria are designed for a specific use. 
In this paper, a general purpose no-reference stereo image 
quality assessment (NR SIQA) approach based on a stacked 
structure of an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed. 
Our work is based on the fact that human brain generates a 
binocular combination of two images, called cyclopean image. 
Discomforts for the visual system occur by the distortions in 
the perceived depth or by distortions in the spatial domain of 
the cyclopean perception [9]. Hence, rather than analyzing the 
right and left images individually, we generate a cyclopean 
image based on motor/sensory fusion process of the brain. The 
synthesized cyclopean perception could be analyzed into 
“phase” and “contrast” matrices or images. To further imitate 
the human’s brain behavior, we use neural networks to 
separately study each of the two extracted images.  Then the 
outputs of these two networks are fed into another neural 
network to generate the final assessment of the stereo images. 
Our contributions can be summarized as: (a) use of binocular 
combined images with maximum coverage of the visual 
discomfort characteristics, (b) proper generation of features to 
reveal wide range of possible distortions, and severities of 
distortions, (c) proper use of stacked neural networks. These 
enable our system to outperform exiting SIQA algorithms.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, a 
review of objective stereo image quality assessment is 
presented. In Section III, we develop our model, describing in 
detail, the image combination, feature extraction and learning 
based quality estimation mechanisms. Section IV, describes 
the experimental results on related stereo image databases and 
Section V concludes the paper.  
II. RELATED WORK 
The necessity of automatic media quality monitoring in 
recent years has attracted a lot of research in the field of 
objective quality assessment. The most recent challenge in this 
field is 3D image and video quality assessment. Visual quality 
evaluation of 3D images is a complex issue which is not easily 
understood, analyzed, and solved. In the following we review 
some quality assessment methods for 3D images which could 
be classified into three groups.  
A. Full Reference Methods 
Most of the FR 3D quality assessment metrics either evaluate 
the quality of left and right images using 2D image quality 
assessment algorithms or evaluate the difference between test 
and reference depth maps. Authors of [10] have studied the 
use of two 2D FR metrics, Structural Similarity Index 
Measure (SSIM [2]), Universal Quality Index (UQI [11]) and 
a 2D RR metric in [12], to evaluate the quality of 3D images. 
In [13], numerous 2D metrics are employed to estimate quality 
of color plus depth encoded video. Authors of [14], in addition 
to disparity information, take advantage of 10 well known 2D 
FR metrics to determine the quality of the stereo images. In 
[15], the authors concluded that using only 2D metrics is not 
sufficient. They improved results with contour analysis of 
synthesized view and mean SSIM calculation in disoccluded 
regions. The method presented in [16] combines stereo 
similarity map and disparity map for 3D quality assessment. 
Benoit et al. improved SSIM for JPEG, JPEG2000 and blurred 
images using additional depth information [17]. In addition to 
left and right image qualities, the disparity quality of the 
distorted pair has been considered for quality assessment [18, 
19]. However, the problem of these methods is that areas with 
low disparities are always considered as lower quality areas 
and the impact of differences in disparity map is assumed to 
be the same everywhere. To assess the quality of stereoscopic 
video in [20] the influence of different depth layers in image 
quality has been studied. The authors found that the quality of 
low disparity areas and video content types effect the 3D 
visual quality.  
Another group of FR methods exploits the characteristics of 
binocular vision to assess the quality of stereo images. A 
metric introduced in [21] that obtains binocular energy of the 
left and right images regarding to spatial frequency in different 
orientations and channels. Based on amplitude changes of this 
energy, it estimates the depth quality that is reconstructed by 
HVS. In [22], similar blocks in the left and right images are 
analyzed by 3D-DCT where mean squared errors measured in 
3D-DCT domain are used for estimation of contrast sensitivity 
and luminance masking characteristics in HVS. Ryu et al. 
proposed a stereo version of the SSIM based on binocular 
quality perception and combined luminance similarity, 
contrast similarity, and structural similarity with binocular 
quality perception model to form the final quality index [23]. 
The proposed metric in [24] is a three-stage model based on 
BJND. In this method after developing a perceptual 
representation for each image, BJND models for the reference 
and distorted images are formed by independent assessment of 
pixels in different classes. The final score is calculated by 
averaging all the assessments. The algorithm presented in 
[25], computes the quality score by applying Multi Scale 
SSIM (MS-SSIM) to a weighted sum of stereo images called 
combined cyclopean image. The weight values are based on 
the response of Gabor filter bank. In [26] an FR metric is 
introduced which uses binocular combination behavior to 
 
 
3 
enhance the performance of SIQA models. It first produces 
two channels of summation and difference from the two 
reference input images and the two test images. Then it 
generates a weighted combination of these two channels and 
exposes this combination to FR quality metrics. In [27], by 
performing consistency check, the left and right images are 
divided into three areas. Then, each region is assessed based 
on amplitude and phase maps of the reference and distorted 
images independently. Finally, region scores are combined to 
achieve a quality score. Lin and Wu decomposed the reference 
pair and the degraded pair of images into different 
spatial/frequency ranges by employing Difference of Gaussian 
(DOG) filter bank [28]. The final quality score is a weighted 
sum of quality scores in different frequency ranges. The 
method [29] learns a multi scale dictionary from the training 
dataset. Then the difference of sparse coefficient vectors of 
reference and test images are used to compute the similarity 
index. The final quality score is the binocular combination of 
the left and right indices.  
B. Reduced-Reference and No-Reference Methods 
 
Reduced Reference and NR image quality assessment 
methods provided for stereo images till now are very limited. 
In [30], the edge information of the reference depth map is 
sent as the reduced reference information. The overall quality 
is achieved from the PSNR of depth maps. The metric 
presented in [31] achieved by comparing sensitivity 
coefficients of cyclopean images as well as coherence between 
their disparity maps. The approaches of [32] are to consider 
color and depth as the sensation of depth in 3D video. In 
model [33], after a divisive normalization in contourlet 
domain for the image and disparity map, the feature 
parameters of the fitted Gaussian distributions are used to 
prepare the quality metric. 
In [34], an NR metric in synthesized image domain based 
on temporal outliers, temporal inconsistencies, and spatial 
outliers is proposed. In [35], an NR quality score for encoded 
images and video were estimated using local information of 
distorted stereo image and its disparity map. The method 
presented in [36] measures luminance and contrast distortion 
in synthesized images. Sohn and Ryu proposed an NR method 
to assess the blurriness and blockiness in binocular vision 
while blurriness, blockiness, and saliency maps were extracted 
from left and right images [37]. By combining blurriness and 
blockiness scores of each image, the final score was 
calculated. Akhter et al. [38] suggested an NR quality 
assessment method for JPEG stereo images. In this method the 
blockiness and blurriness scores of the left and right images, in 
addition to features extracted from imprecise disparity, are 
combined with each other. Chen et al. [9] use 
Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial QUality Evaluator 
(BRISQUE) [6] 2D features extracted from image, 3D features 
extracted from disparity map distribution, and uncertainty map 
to train a support vector regression (SVR). Trained SVR 
detects symmetry or asymmetry of distortion in the left and 
right images and then assesses the stereo quality. In [39] an 
NR quality assessment based on Bayesian theory is presented. 
It models 3D images using hybrid combination based on 
posterior and prior feature distributions.  
To be able to compare our work with other references, we 
test our algorithm on two publically available stereo-image 
databases of LIVE-I [40] and LIVE-II [41]. Image pairs in 
LIVE-I are symmetrically distorted. Images in LIVE-II are 
more challenging because asymmetric distortion is present, 
meaning that one of the two stereo images is distorted while 
the other one is left intact.   
III. PROPOSED MODEL FOR 3D NR IQA 
Here, we use the same assumption as other NR SIQA methods 
that the stereo images are well calibrated.  This means that 
distortions due to weakly calibrated capturing systems, such as 
misaligned cameras, are not of issue. Therefore, only the 
effect of different distortions on binocular and depth 
perception are to be addressed. As is shown in Fig. 1, in the 
first stage two synthesized images are formed using the left 
and right distorted images. The two synthesized images, 
namely contrast and phase images, are made by a perceptual 
combination algorithm. In the second stage of our approach, 
spatial domain natural scene statistics are extracted from each 
of two binocular combined images. The quality estimation 
module in Fig. 1 automatically evaluates the quality of the 
input stereo images. This unit contains three neural networks. 
Each of the first two ones separately evaluates the feature 
vectors of one of the synthesized images. The outputs of these 
networks are fed into a third neural network which produces 
scores that are very close to human judgments.

A. Phase and Contrast Synthesized Images 
Here, our goal is to generate a single image (i.e. cyclopean 
image) from two stereo images. This process, known as 
binocular single vision, is close to what happens in the brain 
through sensory fusion and motor fusion when two images are 
received from the eyes and a single percept is formed.  The 
sensory fusion is performed by the neural elements of the 
brain and the motor fusion is generated by the correct 
positioning of the eyes. As the brain eventually combines 
stereo images, it seems logical to generate a single combined 
image to evaluate the quality of stereo images. Therefore we 
 
 
4 
propose to perform our evaluations on cyclopean image, 
generated by a process similar to the motor/sensory fusion 
process.  In [42] a binocular combination algorithm, called 
DSKL model (Ding, Sperling, Klein, Levi), is presented. They 
present a model for the process of formation of a single pre-
fusion combined image and a model showing what human 
brain does for fusion of images.  We use their post-fusion 
model to generate our synthesize images. In the followings we 
briefly explain findings of [42] about how human brain forms 
a perception. 
This model is found by experimenting with human subjects. 
Two images of sine waves, with different phase shifts, are 
shown to human subjects. Human perception of these images 
depends on phase shifts and relative contrast of the images.  
The left and right images that are shown to human subjects are 
modeled as: 
?? = ?0 +?? cos(2???? + ??) 
?? = ?0 +?? cos(2???? + ??) 
where ?0 is the mean luminance of the sine wave image and ?? 
is the spatial frequency (in terms of cycles per degree, cpd, 
with a typical value of 0.68cpd). Also, ?? and ?? are 
modulation contrasts of the left and right sine waves. Then a 
simple addition of these two images would generate a single 
sine wave image of the form:  
? = ?0? + ??? cos(2???? + ???) 
where ?0? = 2?0, and  
??? = ???
2 +??
2 + 2????  cos (?? ? ??) 
??? = ????1
?? ??? ??+?? ??? ??
?? ??? ??+?? ??? ??
  
This is a combined image that is formed before 
sensory/motor fusion. Eyes move and the nervous system 
adjusts the contrast and a single image is perceived. It is 
experimentally shown by [42] that the eye movement is a 
function of disparity ? and is controlled by a gain control 
parameter ?.  
? = 1 ?
?
?2 + ?
 
In this equation ? is a threshold at which fusion becomes 
apparent (typical value of 0.053). If disparity is less than ?2 
then eye movement and fusion do not occur. When enough 
disparity exists then fusion occurs and a new combined image, 
with new phase ??? and contrast ???, is generated.  
??? = ???
2 +??
2 + 2???? cos (?(?? ? ??))  
??? = ????1
?? ???(???) + ?? sin (???)
?? cos (???) + ??  cos (???)
 
We consider ??? and ??? as two synthetic images. A sample 
stereo pair, from LIVE-I dataset, is shown in Fig. 2. Distorted 
versions of this stereo pair are also present in the dataset. In 
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 we are showing the contrast and phase 
images of the stereo pair and its distorted versions.  We will 
statistically show that the effect of a distortion is different in 
the phase and contrast images. Therefore, contribution of the 
phase image, for the quality assessment of a stereo image, is 
different than that of the contrast image.

B. Feature Extraction 
In our proposed method we study the statistics of the phase 
and contrast images and based on their behaviors, we fit 
different distributions to the histograms of the corresponding 
divisive normalized coefficients. Other distributions are fitted 
at the next stage on pairwise product of each coefficient with 
its adjacent coefficients. The characteristic parameters of these 
distributions are used as two different feature vectors to train a 
stacked ANN.  
Spatial domain natural scene statistics features 
Statistics of natural images follow certain rules [43]. Based on 
this, various successful 2D NR IQA algorithms have been 
designed [4-6]. To reduce the correlation between neighboring 
coefficients of phase, and neighboring coefficients of contrast, 
a normalization procedure is performed on these coefficients. 
Hence, mean subtracted contrast normalized (MSCN) 
coefficients are generated based on the following equation [6]: 
MSCN(?, ?) =
?(?, ?) ? ?(?, ?)
?(?, ?) + ?
           ? ? 1 2…? , ? ?  1…? 
where ?(?, ?) is the phase/contrast value. Also, ?(?, ?) and 
?(?, ?) are representatives of local Gaussian weighted mean 
and variance values and local variances, respectively. To 
avoid division by zero, constant ? is added to the 
denominator. The value of ?(?, ?) inside a window is obtained 
by adding pixels of the window with weights assigned by a 2D 
circularly-symmetric Gaussian weights.   
We observed that MSCN histograms of contrast images have 
symmetric shapes with zero mean, while those of phase 
images have asymmetrical shapes and nonzero means. Also 
the shapes and variances of distributions are different for 
different distortions depending on the perceptual severity of 
the distortion. Figure 5 shows normalized histograms of 
MSCN coefficients for phase and contrast of a sample image.  
These are for cases when the image is distorted by white noise 
(WN), JPEG2000 compression (JP2K), JPEG compression 
(JPEG), Gaussian blur (Blur) and fast-fading (FF).  
To model the distribution of MSCN coefficients of contrast, a 
Generalized Gaussian Distribution (GGD) function, which is 
symmetric and has a zero mean, is utilized based on the 
following equation:  
?(?; ?, ?2) =
?
2??(1/?)
exp (?(|
?
?
|)?) ,    ? = ??
?(
1
?
)
?(
3
?
)
  
The parameter ? controls the shape of the distribution, ?2 
represents variance of the distribution, and ?(?) is gamma 
function, ?(?) = ? ???1?????  
?
?=0
. For each contrast image 
the fitted GGD shape parameter, ?, and variance, ?2, are 
selected as the first two features.  
Unlike the contrast, to which symmetric GGD can be fitted, to 
estimate the shape of an MSCN histogram of the phase images 
we use an Asymmetric GGD (AGGD).  Modeling of AGGD is 
done based on the following equations: 
?(?; ?, ??
2, ??
2) =
{
 
 
 
 
?
(?? + ??)? (
1

)
exp (?(

?(

?(

In the above equations ? is the shape parameter and controls 
the shape of the distribution, ??
2, ??
2 are the distribution 
variances of left and right respectively. The parameters 
?, ?? , ?? , ? are extracted as the first four features of the phase 
image. 
In Fig. 6, we show the ability of these features to separate the 
distortion in each of the two synthesized images. To generate 
Fig. 6, we calculated the distributions shown in Fig. 5 and 
fitted AGGD on the MSCN histograms of phase images and 
then fitted GGD on the histograms of the contrast images.

fitted to histograms of MSCN coefficients of contrast. 
In addition to MSCN coefficients, the statistical relations 
among neighboring coefficients are also modeled. To this end, 
an AGGD is fitted to the histogram of the pairwise 
multiplication of MSCN coefficients in four directions as 
defined in [6]. We extract a feature vector of 40 elements from 
the phase image and a vector of 36 features from the contrast 
image. These features are comprised of distribution shape, 
mean, and the left/right variances of each four directions, in 
addition to the AGGD parameters for the phase and GGD 
parameters for the contrast in two scales. For each of the two 
synthesized images of phase and contrast the normalized 
histograms, of pairwise multiplications in one of the four 
directions, are shown for different distortions in Fig. 7. The 
corresponding fitted AGGDs are exhibited in Fig. 8.

Images that are used in these experiments are from LIVE-I 
and LIVE-II datasets. To determine the effect of a feature on 
the process of stereo quality assessment, the correlation is 
measured between each feature and subjective scores, in all 
images. If a feature has a high correlation with the Mean 
Opinion Scores (MOS), then the presence of such feature in a 
vector will result in objective quality scores that are close to 
subjective ones. Figure 9 shows the Pearson’s Linear 
Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) values of the features of phase 
and contrast, with subjective quality scores for images with 
different distortion types. Parts (a) and (b) show correlation 
values of phase and contrast features respectively, for images 
of LIVE-I database.

Correlations of MOS with features extracted from (c) phase, and (d) contrast, 
calculated for LIVE-II distorted-image dataset. 
Likewise, parts (c) and (d) of Fig. 9 show correlations for the 
LIVE-II database. High correlation levels in these graphs 
indicate that, for both LIVE-I and LIVE-II databases [40, 41], 
features obtained from synthesized images are highly 
effective. The collection of these features is a good descriptor 
of 3D perceptual quality of stereo images. The extracted 
features, from images with white noise, have the highest 
correlation with visual quality features. The lowest correlation 
is for the features obtained from JPEG compressed images. 
C. Quality estimation 
Stacked generalization, which was first presented by Wolpert 
[44], is an effective method for combining a number of 
generalizers. It uses partitioning of training data or the feature 
space to elevate the generalization performance of the whole 
system. It consists of a number of “level-0” generalizers where 
each, is independently trained with a subset of the available 
features. Outputs of level-0 generalizers are combined by 
going into “level-1”. This combination of level-0 outputs is 
not just a linear combination but it is a means of combining a 
number of generalizers to produce a new one. Partitioning of 
the feature space at the level-0 should be in a way that a 
complex computation task is partitioned into a number of 
computationally simple tasks. Hence, by combination of the 
results of level-0 generalizers the desired solution of the initial 
task is obtained.  
Since ANNs are powerful tools for nonlinear approximations 
and they mimic real-time complex biological human decision 
system, they are good candidates for stacked generalization. 
We propose to use three feed-forward ANNs, two at level-0 
and one at level-1.  
As shown in Fig. 10, each of the two level-0 parallel ANNs 
receives features of one of the synthesized images. The first 
neural network gets the features of the phase, and the second 
one is fed by the features of the contrast image. Each of these 
networks is trained with train set images. The third network, 
the refiner in level-1, is trained with the test results of the first 
two networks. In other words, the third network, as an expert 
quality assessor, learns how to correct the opinions of other 
experts to achieve better results.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Here we evaluate the performance of our NR SIQA 
proposed method. First, each of the two level-0 ANNs 
independently, and once all of the three ANNs in stacked 
model together, are trained and tested.. Quality scores 
obtained by the proposed method have been compared with 
the best results obtained from the best assessment methods in 
this area. 
A. Databases 
In the following we explain characteristics of LIVE-I and 
LIVE-II databases.    
1) LIVE-I 3D Image Quality Database 
LIVE-I 3D database contains 20 reference and 365 
symmetrical distorted stereo images. Among these distorted 
images, 80 pairs are allocated to the following distortions: 
JPEG compression (JPEG), JPEG2000 (JP2K) compression, 
additive White Gaussian Noise (WN), and Fast-Fading (FF) 
model based on the Rayleigh fading channel. Also, 45 pairs 
are dedicated to Gaussian Blur (Blur) with different distortion 
levels. All of the damaged stereo images in this database are 
symmetrically distorted. It means that both the left and right 
images have been equally affected by the same distortion 
process. In addition, the subjective quality scores of difference 
MOS are in the range of -10 to 60. 
2) LIVE-II 3D Image Quality Database 
The LIVE-II 3D database contains 8 reference and 360 
distorted stereo images. In the database, for each type of 
distortion, in addition to three pairs of symmetric distorted 
versions, there are six pairs of asymmetric distorted ones. This 
means that left and right images are distorted at different 
levels or one of them has full quality while the other’s quality 
is degraded. This characteristic makes the quality assessment 
of the stereo images in the LIVE-II dataset more challenging. 
Fig. 11 shows samples of symmetric and asymmetric distorted 
images from the LIVE-I and LIVE-II datasets. The human 
based DMOS scores are in the range of 0 to 100.

B. Network training and test 
Each of the single models includes a two layer feed forward 
neural network, with sigmoid activation function neurons in its 
hidden layer, and linear output layer. Each neural network is 
configured for a particular application through the process of 
training. Training will continue until the error subsides to a 
desired value. To avoid overtraining of networks, we used 
Resilient back Propagation (RP) training law. The extracted 
features from the two synthesized images of phase and 
contrast are utilized separately by the two level-0 networks 
with the same number of 25 neurons in the hidden layer. The 
number of neurons for the level-1 refiner network is also set to 
three.  
Our no-reference method requires training to determine the 
optimum weights for the two layers of ANNs. To evaluate 
each of the single models, like most of the learning based IQA 
methods [6, 9, 38, 39] we train each one using 80 percent of 
database images, which are randomly selected. The remaining 
20 percent of images are used as the test set. There is no 
overlap between the selected training images and those used 
for testing. To ensure independence of the results from the set 
of images selected for training or test, the train-test process 
was repeated 1000 times. Median of all obtained results is 
reported as the final result [6, 9, 38, 39]. The entire operation 
for each model is independently done on the LIVE-I and 
LIVE-II databases. The results for each data set will later be 
compared with other assessment methods. 
C. Performance Evaluation of Model 
We compare the power of the models using only the features 
of phase, contrast and also the influence of the third corrector 
ANN to improve the assessment efficiency. Hence, scatter 
plots of objective scores versus subjective scores in a single 
train-test process, for the first two single models and also the 
final model on LIVE-I and LIVE-II datasets are displayed in 
Fig. 12.  
In plots of Fig. 12, the vertical axis denotes the subjective 
ratings of the perceived distortions and the horizontal one 
indicates the corresponding predicted quality scores. If the 
subjective and objective scores are exactly equal, then all 
points will be on the ? =  ? line (i.e. red dashed line). Hence, 
scattering of points close to the bisector of the first quadrant is 
an indication of better performance of that approach. The 
RMSE, SRCC, PLCC and the equation of the best fitted (the 
black solid) line to the data are calculated in each plot. As can 
be seen, the results of the stacked model, consisting of the 
stacked ANN, are more correlated with the visual scores as 
compared to the initial simple models. In most cases, the fitted 
line almost matches the bisector line that shows the ability of 
the model to predict correct image quality scores. Moreover, 
lower RMSE values in both LIVE-I and LIVE-II databases are 
another evidence of this claim.

The Bland-Altman [45] plots of the same data are shown in 
Fig. 13. In this graphical model the differences between 
subjective and objective scores are plotted against the average 
values of these scores. The horizontal solid line indicates the 
mean value of the difference between subjective and objective 
scores. A distance of 1.96 times the standard deviation of 
difference values is called Re-Producibility Coefficient (RPC). 
The two dashed lines, called the limits of agreement, are 
drawn at a distance of plus and minus RPC from the mean 
difference line. Narrower RPC values show greater capability 
of stacked model for quality assessment of stereo images. 
D. Comparison to 2D State of the Art Methods 
In this section we compare our proposed model with the state 
of the art 2D IQA methods.  PSNR, SSIM [2] and MS-SSIM 
[3] are full reference 2D IQA metrics. We also compare our 
method with three no-reference methods of BRISQUE 
(BLIND/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator [6]), 
DIIVINE (Distortion Identification-based Image Verity and 
Integrity Evaluation [4]), and BLIINDS-II (Blind Integrity 
Notator using DCT Statistics-II [5]). In order to apply these 
approaches to 3D images, we separately estimate the quality 
of left and right images and the average of them is reported as 
the 3D quality of stereo pair. Again, we want to find the 
correlation between the features that these methods offer with 
subjective scores. For example, we want to know how 
correlated PSNR values of images are with subjective scores.

Hence, the overall PLCC and SROCC are calculated, as 
shown in Table 4. We tested our stacked method and the 
mentioned FR and NR features on the images of the LIVE-I 
and LIVE-II databases. The accuracy of our prediction is 
higher than other 2D methods. The superiority is more visible 
for the images of the LIVE-II dataset. This indicates that only 
averaging the 2D qualities is not adequate to describe the 
quality of stereo images especially for the asymmetrically 
distorted stereo images. Our proposed features extracted from 
the phase and contrast images include a wide range of 2D and 
3D aspects of the binocular perception that result in high 
performances for both symmetric and asymmetric distorted 
stereo pairs.

E. Comparison to State of the Art 3D Methods 
Here, we compare our NR method with four full referenced 
methods (FR) [17, 25, 26, 29], two reduced reference methods 
(RR) [32, 33] and three no-reference methods (NR) [9, 38, 39] 
for stereo image quality assessment. The first FR method is 
based on SSIM and additional depth information [17], the 
second is the cyclopean MS-SSIM [25] which considers the 
effect of binocular rivalry on 3D quality of stereo images. The 
third algorithm is the SDM-GSSIM [26]. The forth algorithm 
is based on the difference of sparse coefficient vectors of the 
reference and distorted pairs proposed in [29]. The RR method 
proposed in [32] uses the edge information of depth and color 
data in the corresponding areas of images. Algorithm of [33] 
utilizes parameters that are extracted from the image and its 
depth in the contourlet domain. Among the existing no-
reference techniques, best results belong to an application 
specific algorithm proposed by Akhter [38], and two general 
purpose algorithms proposed by Chen [9] and Shao [39]. 
Similar to most quality assessment techniques, the Spearman's 
Rank Ordered Correlation Coefficient (SROCC), Pearson's 
Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Root Mean 
Squared Error (RMSE) are used to evaluate the performance. 
Closer values of PLCC and SROCC to 1 indicate higher 
correlations to subjective values. On the other hand, smaller 
quantities of RMSE are more desired. Our results of PLCC, 
SROCC and RMSE are compared with the above mentioned 
methods, reported in [9, 39, 26, 29, 33]. 
1) Performance Comparison on LIVE-I Database 
PLCC, SROCC and RMSE results of our models, tested on 
LIVE-I dataset, are evaluated and compared with other 
methods in the left parts of Tables 1, 2, and 3 respectively. 
The best two NR/RR results in each column are bolded and 
the best FR one is marked in italic. 
It can be seen that if we use one of the synthesized images, the 
results would be comparable with the referential and non-
referential methods. The results that we obtain by our final 
stacked model, using both synthesized images, are better than 
the first two single models and outperform even the best FR 
results for all distortions. In comparison with the state of the 
art NR SIQA methods, our method defeats all methods in WN 
and FF distortions. It also produces results that are very close 
to [39] for the other three distortions. The overall results, in 
the last column, indicate that in average, our final model has at 
least 2% better PLCC, SROCC results and at least one unit 
lower RMSE values than FR methods.  
2) Performance Comparison on LIVE-II Database 
Similar to LIVE-I dataset, PLCC, SROCC and RMSE results 
are measured, after we applied our models to the images of the 
LIVE-II dataset. The right half of Tables 1, 2, and 3 show our 
results as compared to other assessment algorithms. This 
dataset has added asymmetrically distorted images, which has 
made their quality assessment much more complicated. Our 
two initial models, which use only one synthesized image, 
perform below that of Chen's [9] and the cyclopean MS-SSIM 
[25]. But our main stacked model produces better results than 
the mentioned references. In the group of NR/RR methods, 
our results are always one of the two best results for all 
distortions. Our stacked model surpasses the best existing 
PLCC and SROCC values by more than 2%. Our overall 
results are also superior to all other methods by at least 3%. 
However, FR methods, which have access to the reference 
image, are expected to have better performance than the NR 
and RR techniques. Nevertheless, our NR approach not only 
has better results than NR methods, but it also defeats all FR 
methods in each distortion. This is due to the use of proper 
descriptors, strong stacked ANN structure, and the use of 
appropriately formed synthesized images. These synthesized 
images reveal the effects of different distortions on the 
perceived image. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
We proposed a no-reference stereo image quality assessment 
method. Inspired by the sensory-motor fusion of the brain, we 
performed binocular combination of every stereo-image pair 
to produce a pair of synthesized images (phase and contrast). 
These images proved to be highly valuable in exposing the 
type and severity of different distortions. We analyzed the 
spatial domain statistics of the generated phase and contrast 
images. Two different feature vectors can be extracted from 
every two synthetic images. These features are sensitive to the 
changes caused by different distortions. We showed that these 
2D sets of features, extracted from the phase and contrast 
images, can provide highly reliable 3D quality assessment 
measures. The proposed quality assessment was implemented 
by two parallel ANN channels as the first layer of the 
proposed quality estimation structure. The resulting scores 
were refined using a second layer. The results showed that our 
model significantly outperforms most of the state of the art 3D 
image quality assessment methods including no-reference, 
reduced-reference and full-reference ones. The synthesized 
images used in this method were generated simply and 
quickly. The contrast and phase images were synthesized in 
0.37s by a 3.4 GHz, Core i7 computer with 16 GB RAM. 
Whereas, the average production time for a Gabor cyclopean 
used in [9] was 20.72s on the same hardware platform. In 
addition, our approach has the potential of parallel 
implementation. This is true for the formation of the 
synthesized images, as well as the feature extraction part of 
the algorithm.  Our method basically uses spatial domain 
features, which have lower computational complexity than the 
transform domain features. Furthermore, direct quality 
assessment is performed without the need for an initial 
classification of the distortion type and/or the asymmetry of 
the distortion.
